# Description
>*You're walking the final stretch of the sloping lawn, the wind picking up and carrying a familiar sound. At first, it's just a low, constant murmur on the air, like a distant river. But as you get closer, the sound resolves into a chorus of individual calls: a soft hoot here, a sharp screech there, the low, throaty groan of a barn owl.*
>*The Owlery looms ahead, a tall, round stone tower that looks as if it has stood for a thousand years. Its upper half is an open latticework of windows and arches, letting the wind whistle through and the owls fly freely in and out. The scent reaches you before you even enter—a dry, dusty smell of feathers and a pungent, musky aroma of droppings and old parchment.*
>*You step over the threshold and into the cool, shadowed interior. The air is thick with the rustle of wings and the silent, patient stare of dozens of owls. The floor is covered in a thick layer of straw and discarded owl pellets, crunching under your feet. All around you, the stone walls are lined with a thousand little nooks and perches, filled with birds of every shape and size. Great eagle owls sit like wise old judges, their amber eyes unblinking, while tiny scops owls flit between the rafters like nervous thoughts.*
>*A single ray of sunlight pierces through a high window, illuminating a cloud of dancing dust motes and drifting downy feathers. It’s a place of organized chaos, a living postal service where every bird is waiting for its next task.*
