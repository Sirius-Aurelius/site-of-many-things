# Description
A mysterious room in an unused section of the school that lies near the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.4.05 School Kitchens\|School Kitchens]] and the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.3.01 Hufflepuff Tower\|Hufflepuff Tower]] (*presumably somewhere beneath the entrance and reception halls)*

There are windows, but they seem to be more like paintings; the view as if from inside a greenhouse. The slowly moving images of crops and nature beyond the 'windows' cast no light into this pitch dark, cold room.

Contains four large 'coldframes' on tabletops, containing plants in some kind of stasis. At least one of these is known to the PCs ([[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/5.0 Ingredients/05.1 Plants/Bundle of star grass\|Star Grass]])

Beyond those, a large wall of tiny drawers (and no windows) stretches wall to wall, floor to (high) ceiling. When this wall was first approached by [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie Weasley]] in [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/9.0 Chronicles/Session 01 - Welcome to Hogwarts\|Session 1]] she was struck by an increasingly cold icy aura that inflicted damage.
