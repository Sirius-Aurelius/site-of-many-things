# Description
A mysterious room in an unused section of the school that lies near the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.4.05 School Kitchens\|School Kitchens]] and the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.3.01 Hufflepuff Tower\|Hufflepuff Tower]] (*presumably somewhere beneath the entrance and reception halls)*

There are windows, but they seem to be more like paintings; the view as if from inside a greenhouse. The slowly moving images of crops and nature beyond the 'windows' cast no light into this pitch dark, cold room.

Contains four large 'coldframes' on tabletops, containing plants in some kind of stasis. At least one of these is known to the PCs ([[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/5.0 Ingredients/05.1 Plants/Star grass, Bundle of\|Star Grass]])

Beyond those, a large wall of tiny drawers (and no windows) stretches wall to wall, floor to (high) ceiling. When this wall was first approached by [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie Weasley]] in [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/9.0 Chronicles/Session 01 - Welcome to Hogwarts\|Session 1]] she was struck by an increasingly cold icy aura that inflicted damage.

The room is filled with inert plants and a freezing aura that harms [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie Weasley]]. Hereafter known as the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.01 Cold Plant Room\|Cold Plant Room]]                                                                                             |

[[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Kiko\|Kiko]] behaves protectively towards them throughout, though allows the students to lead the assault. Whilst there they briefly observe some strange crystals, the effects of which later become apparent in the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.01 Cold Plant Room\|Cold Plant Room]]                             |

Vi questions how the ministry knew of her ability even before she did, and resolves to ask her mother about this at some stage                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

They explore the freezer field, a strange latrine like storage unit and the desk of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Jackdaw Finch\|Jackdaw Finch]], and presumably his brother, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Septimus Finch\|Septimus Finch]] before him                                                                                                                                                                     |

[[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] fires a [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Periculum OR Verdimillious\|Periculum]] into the void and it recedes beyond sight. [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] give Basil a cautious and consensual 'swirly' to see what lies down there                                                                                                                             |

After retreating once he remains longer on his second swirly and sees a horrifying visage of a wailing ghost, mouth agape with jaw dropped to its waist in an unnatural and silent scream                                                                                                                                                                                          |

She also finds a large stack of seemingly coded papers, taking a random sample of 12 for future use or investigation. Drawing this to [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]]'s attention, Vi gathers up 10 further papers from the collection of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Septimus Finch\|Septimus Finch]] on various herbological and alchemical subjects. |

Upon arriving, they find the scenes in the 'greenhouse' windows to have changed (at Jackdaw's behest) since they were last here                                                                                                                                             |
