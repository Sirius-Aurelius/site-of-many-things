# Description
**The long spiral staircase:**
>*The journey to the Divination classroom is a climb into a different world. The spiral staircase, seemingly endless, leaves your legs aching and your mind spinning before you even arrive. As you reach the top, the final step is a creaking, wooden trapdoor. The moment it swings open, a thick, cloying atmosphere spills out, hitting you like a physical wave.*
>*The air is heavy and still, saturated with the sickly-sweet scent of burning jasmine incense and the bitter, earthy tang of stale tea leaves. The blast that hits you is surprisingly humid, making your cheeks instantly flush and start to feel sticky.*

**Climbing the ladder to the classroom:** 
>*Climbing up into the room itself you find yourself in a relatively cosy circular space, not brightly lit by any window but by the flickering, dancing glow of a massive fireplace. overlaying this is a hazy, purplish light that seems to obscure the details on everything, making the shapes of crystal balls and other paraphernalia seem blurred and indistinct. Piles of deep crimson and scarlet velvet cushions are scattered across low tables, beckoning you to sink in and surrender to the strange air.* 
>*The only sound is the faint, almost-hypnotic tick-tock of a clock hidden somewhere within the tower's clutter, counting the moments until fate is revealed.* 
>*It's a place that confuses and disorients, a heavy and stifling den that already feels less like a classroom and more like a dream you can't quite wake up from.*
