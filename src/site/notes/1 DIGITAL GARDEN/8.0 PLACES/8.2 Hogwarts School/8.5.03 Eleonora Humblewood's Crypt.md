| [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/9.0 Chronicles/Session 06 - Arania Exumai!\|Session 06 - Arania Exumai!]]           | [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] hit the library in the final week of the first half term. Cassie seeks information on the whereabouts of the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]], whilst Vi researches ancient magic. Both also seek any information about [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)\|Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)]] or [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.03 Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt\|8.5.03 Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt]] but find nothing more.                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/9.0 Chronicles/Session 05 - Trouble at the Mine\|Session 05 - Trouble at the Mine]] | [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] head to the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.4.05 School Kitchens\|School Kitchens]] to ask the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.2 Factions/07.2.18 Hogwarts Kitchen Elves\|Hogwarts Kitchen Elves]] if they know anything about [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)\|Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)]] or [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.03 Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt\|8.5.03 Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt]]. They find [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Fizzy\|Fizzy]], who seems more interested in feeding them and showing them around. He does explain that the only level he knows beneath this one is the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.4.05.01 Pantry Realms\|8.4.05.01 Pantry Realms]]                   |
| [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/9.0 Chronicles/Session 05 - Trouble at the Mine\|Session 05 - Trouble at the Mine]] | [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] sneaks away and meets [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Shonky\|Shonky]], a gruff worker-elf. [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Shonky\|Shonky]] advises that one way to access [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.03 Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt\|8.5.03 Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt]] might be to find the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]] in just the right place to require a staircase down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/9.0 Chronicles/Session 07 - Falling Down\|Session 07 - Falling Down]]               | [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] seek to test the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]]'s limitations. Aside from evidence that this is the right place they struggle and fail to make anything of their own choosing manifest. With the exception of a staircase - perhaps to [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.03 Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt\|8.5.03 Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt]] - which the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]] does permit them to conjure. Though possibly for reasons other than those the party intended.                         |
| [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/9.0 Chronicles/Session 07 - Falling Down\|Session 07 - Falling Down]]               | Returning to ground level after descending into the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]] in search of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.03 Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt\|8.5.03 Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] force their way out and back into the castle proper. They are greeted by a scene of extraordinary destruction, as an entire collonaded section of the castle has crumbled in the quake. Screams of terror - perhaps even of pain - can be heard coming from the occupied sections of the castle beyond |
