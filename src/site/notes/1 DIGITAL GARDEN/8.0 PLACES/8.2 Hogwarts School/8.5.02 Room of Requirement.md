| [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/9.0 Chronicles/Session 06 - Arania Exumai!\|Session 06 - Arania Exumai!]]           | [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] hit the library in the final week of the first half term. Cassie seeks information on the whereabouts of the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]], whilst Vi researches ancient magic. Both also seek any information about [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)\|Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)]] or [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.03 Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt\|8.5.03 Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt]] but find nothing more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/9.0 Chronicles/Session 05 - Trouble at the Mine\|Session 05 - Trouble at the Mine]] | [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] sneaks away and meets [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Shonky\|Shonky]], a gruff worker-elf. [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Shonky\|Shonky]] advises that one way to access [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.03 Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt\|8.5.03 Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt]] might be to find the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]] in just the right place to require a staircase down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Entering into a seeming Broom Cupboard not too far into the disused section beyond the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.4.05 School Kitchens\|School Kitchens]] [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] thinks hard about 'requiring' a London Cheescake as evience this is the Room of Requirement, thus making one appear.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Aside from evidence that this is the right place they struggle and fail to make anything of their own choosing manifest. With the exception of a staircase - perhaps to [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.03 Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt\|8.5.03 Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt]] - which the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]] does permit them to conjure. Though possibly for reasons other than those the party intended.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/9.0 Chronicles/Session 07 - Falling Down\|Session 07 - Falling Down]]               | [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] start descending a seemingly endless staircase that appeared within the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]]. Requiring a faster way down, they lose [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] down a slide that appeared. Catching him, they manifest a landing and [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] tends [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]]'s wounds as [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] investigates a door that has appeared                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

A small blue mote of light, (similar in colour to the wraith-like figure that swept towards [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] from the depths beneath the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.01 Cold Plant Room\|Cold Plant Room]]) hovers through the wall and towards [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]]. As [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] casts [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Impervius\|Impervius]] on [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] the mote, becoming aggressive, fails to find any purchase on [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]]'s mind |
| [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/9.0 Chronicles/Session 07 - Falling Down\|Session 07 - Falling Down]]               | Repelled by either or both the mental fortitude of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] and the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Impervius\|Impervius]] charm of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], a strange mote of blue light in the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]] retreats back into the wall from whence it came. The DIADEMs interpret this to be some manifestation of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)\|Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)]] attempting to contact or somehow harm or aid them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/9.0 Chronicles/Session 07 - Falling Down\|Session 07 - Falling Down]]               | Late into the night now, with lessons due to start in a few short hours, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] give up on reaching the bottom of the staircase and turn back towards the occupied floors of the castle. [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] wills the stairs to become shorter, which they do, however the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]] seems to refuse to permit them to leave yet                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/9.0 Chronicles/Session 07 - Falling Down\|Session 07 - Falling Down]]               | Whilst underground, and protected by the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] experience extreme ground tremors as some kind of earthquake  or localised seismic event shakes the entire foundations of the School. Held in the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]] the DIADEMs suffer no ill effects or injuries from the quake and the room seems to allow them once again to access the broom closet (and exit door) above                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

They are greeted by a scene of extraordinary destruction, as an entire collonaded section of the castle has crumbled in the quake. Screams of terror - perhaps even of pain - can be heard coming from the occupied sections of the castle beyond                                                                                                                                                                                 |
