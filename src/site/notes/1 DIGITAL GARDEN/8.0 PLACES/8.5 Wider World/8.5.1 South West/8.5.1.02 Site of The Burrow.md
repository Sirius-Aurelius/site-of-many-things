# Description

From player back story:
>	_"Our children deserve a proper, stable home," she'd stated, her voice calm but firm, gesturing pointedly at a particularly persistent leak dripping into a bucket. "A tent, no matter how charmed, is hardly a suitable environment for a family with such a... unique daughter, especially with what's coming."_
>[[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Lavender Weasley\|Lavender Weasley]] to Ministry of Magic officials

>_Lavender made it clear that if the Ministry was so concerned about her daughter's future and allegiance, and now about her visions of impending conflict, they could demonstrate their commitment. Her demand was audacious but calculated: land in Devon, near Ottery St Catchpole, a rural area known for its strong magical community and discreet, established wizarding families._
