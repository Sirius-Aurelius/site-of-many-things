# Description

It was believed by the residents of Hogsmeade that the proprietor, in an effort to save space, used a Shrinking Charm on all of his wares. However, he miscalculated and ended up shrinking his wares down to such a small size that he couldn't resize them again, effectively losing his entire stock. By the 1890–1891 school year, all that was left of the shop was a building on the outskirts of Hogsmeade which had a few bits of abandoned furniture inside it
