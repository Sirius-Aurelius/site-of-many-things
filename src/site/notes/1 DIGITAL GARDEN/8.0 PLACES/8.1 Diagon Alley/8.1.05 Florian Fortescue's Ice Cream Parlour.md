# Description

For a wizard's ice cream parlour, this place seems rather similar to a Baskin Robbins. Colourful decorations, seats, tables everything really. The only thing at first glance that separates it from muggle ice cream shops are the floating ice cream decorations around the area. 

The bearded wizard behind the counter offers a warm smile as you enter the shop.
