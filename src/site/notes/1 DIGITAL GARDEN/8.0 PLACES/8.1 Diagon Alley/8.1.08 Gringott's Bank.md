# Description

You approach a snowy white building which towers over the nearby shops of Diagon Alley. A goblin adorned in a scarlet and gold uniform is stationed at the top of the white stone steps, standing beside the establishment's burnished bronze doors. 

As you walk inside, you come to face a pair of silver doors, with an inscribed warning:

>*Enter, stranger, but take heed* 
>*Of what awaits the sin of greed,*
>*For those who take, but do not earn,* 
>*Must pay most dearly in their turn,*
>*So if you seek beneath our floors* 
>*A treasure that was never yours,*
>*Thief, you have been warned, beware* 
>*Of finding more than treasure there.*

A pair of goblins usher you through the elaborate threshold into a vast marble hall, wherein over a hundred goblins sit on high stools behind long counters. They go about their business, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins on brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. Many doors lead off the grand hall, and yet more goblins can be seen escorting people in and out of them.

You wait your turn in line for a goblin at a counter to summon you.
