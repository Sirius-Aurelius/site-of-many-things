# Description

It's a rather... cramped establishment, with books piled high all over the store. Every shelf in sight was stacked to the ceiling with books that ranged in size from postage stamps in covers of silk, to those as large as paving stones bound in leather. There were books with peculiar symbols on them, and even a few with nothing in them at all. The only peculiar sight is a single shelf, which appears to be not only empty, but damaged.

A rather tired-looking wizard stands behind the counter in the back, saying nothing. Instead, he merely watches you as you peruse the bookstore.
