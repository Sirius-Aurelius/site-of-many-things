# Description

The moment you open the door to this shop, you come to realize something: There is not that much room inside. Every inch of wall is hidden by cages. It is smelly and very loud because the occupants of these cages are all squeaking, squawking, jabbering or hissing. You know, the typical noises you would hear in a magical pet shop.

Before you even get a chance to look around, a rather eccentric-looking witch excitedly approaches you.
