# Description

Now this is a messy shop if you have ever seen one. Multiple floors, shelves reaching from floor to the very top of the building, all filled very messily to the brim with a variety of sized boxes, presumably containing various kinds of wands. 

The shop appears to be empty, until you hear the sound of wheels, followed by a rolling ladder sliding across the shelves, containing a white-haired man, who, upon seeing you, slowly climes down.
