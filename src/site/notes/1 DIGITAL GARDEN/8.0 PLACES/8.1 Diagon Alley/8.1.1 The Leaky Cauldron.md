# Description

It's a small grubby-looking pub and inn, with a bar and a number of tables in the shadows of the corners. In stark contrast to the dingy ground floor, there are some unexpectedly pleasant rooms upstairs where passing wizards and witches can stay for the night. These rooms are accessed by a handsome wooden staircase, and contain comfortable beds, highly polished oak furniture, a crackling fire which is always burning in the grate to welcome the visitor to their lodgings, and in certain cases, a talking mirror.

A rather old, scruffy woman stands behind the bar, cleaning a beer mug and paying little attention to you. A few patrons also dot the various tables, but none give you a second look.
