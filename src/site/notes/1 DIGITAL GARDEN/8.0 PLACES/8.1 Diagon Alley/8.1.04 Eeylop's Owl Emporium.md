# Description

It's quite the dim shop compared to the others in Diagon Alley. Small in size, and filled with owls. Of course the latter should be obvious, considering you're in a store that sells owls. 

The rather old wizard that's currently feeding the owls in the cages just inside the window nods his head upon seeing you walk in.
