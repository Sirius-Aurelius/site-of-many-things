# Description

The store is quite colourful. Like someone had set off a party in a box in here. A huge variety of items stock the shelves around you, ranging from smoke bombs to fireworks all the way to what was described as headless hats. It makes you curious... but also a bit nervous at the same time. 

A white-bearded man sits behind the counter, intriguingly watching you.
