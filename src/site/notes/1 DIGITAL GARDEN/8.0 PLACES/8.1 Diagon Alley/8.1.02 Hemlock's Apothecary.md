# Description

It's a fascinating shop this one, though comes with a smell akin to a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stand on the floor, Jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders line the walls. Bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws. hang from the ceiling. The very definition of a potion ingredient shop. The spry old man behind the counter smiles at you as you enter.

"Welcome! Young witches and wizards. The name is [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Harley Hemlock\|Harley Hemlock]]. What can I do for you today?"
