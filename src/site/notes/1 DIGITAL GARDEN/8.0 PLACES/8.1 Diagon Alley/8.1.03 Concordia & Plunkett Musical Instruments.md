# Description

Upon walking in, the first thought in your mind is wow, this place is loud! Filled with the... somewhat chaotic noise of several self-playing instruments, you cannot help but admire the sheer number of products that are displayed around the store. Harps, lutes, bagpipes, you name it. 

At first you don't see an owner, until a young witch pops out from behind one of the large shelves.
