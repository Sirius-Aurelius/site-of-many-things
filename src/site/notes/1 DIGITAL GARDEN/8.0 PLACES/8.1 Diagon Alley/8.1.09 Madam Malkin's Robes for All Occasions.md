# Description

The first thing you notice as you enter this shop is that every surface is covered in fabric. Whether it be the walls, the floor, even the tables and chairs. It was like the whole place is carpeted. A variety of differently coloured and designed robes hang from the walls and ceiling, as well as other accessories scattered around the store.

Upon seeing you walk in, the short witch who you can only guess is Madam Malkin smiles at you from across the shop.
