### Dark Lords

Dark Lords are among the most feared and dangerous dark wizards, capable of mastering the darkest and most forbidden forms of magic, including the creation of Horcruxes. A Horcrux is a powerful and sinister magical object that allows a wizard to anchor a piece of their soul outside their body, granting them a twisted form of immortality. 

To create a Horcrux, a Dark Lord must commit murder, using the act to tear apart their soul and hide the fragment within an object. This process not only makes them exceedingly difficult to kill but also corrupts their very essence, rendering them inhuman. Lord Voldemort is the most notorious Dark Lord known to have created multiple Horcruxes, ensuring his survival beyond death and amplifying his reign of terror. 

Dark Lords who pursue this path of immortality are driven by an insatiable lust for power and a willingness to sacrifice anything, even their own humanity, to achieve dominance over the magical and non-magical worlds alike.
