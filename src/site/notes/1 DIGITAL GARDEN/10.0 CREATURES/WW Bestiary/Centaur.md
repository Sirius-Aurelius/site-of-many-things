## Description

With the upper body of a human and the lower body of a horse, centaurs are deeply attuned to the natural world, particularly the heavens, and are known for their mastery of divination through astrology. They study the movements of the planets and stars with a reverence that far surpasses any human wizardâ€™s understanding of the subject. This profound wisdom makes them respected, but also somewhat feared, as their insights often seem cryptic and beyond the grasp of ordinary witches and wizards.

#### Nature and Society

* Though centaurs possess the intelligence and speech of humans, they do not consider themselves part of wizarding society and generally avoid involvement in human affairs.
* They are distrustful of humans, often seeing them as meddlesome and shortsighted, which has led to tense relations between centaurs and wizards throughout history.
* This tension is only heightened by the fact that centaurs are ==classified as Beasts by the Ministry of Magic==, a label they resent due to their strong sense of dignity and intelligence.

#### Behavior and Interaction

* While centaurs are not inherently hostile, they are fiercely protective of their herds and territories, reacting swiftly to perceived threats with deadly accuracy using their powerful bows and arrows.
* However, they adhere to a strong code of conduct, valuing honor and wisdom above all else.
* Centaurs rarely offer aid to humans, but when they do, it is often in moments of great need, and their knowledge is never given lightly.
* Wizards who seek out centaurs for their wisdom must approach with great care and respect, as these creatures are quick to take offense and have little patience for human arrogance.
