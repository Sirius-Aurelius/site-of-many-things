### Description

Acromantulas are giant, highly intelligent spiders native of the dense rainforests of Borneo, though they have been illegally bred and introduced to various locations, including the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.4 Hogwarts Valley/8.4.1 Forbidden Forest\|Forbidden Forest]] at Hogwarts. These monstrous arachnids can grow up to 15 feet in leg span and are covered in thick black hair, with large, glossy eyes that enable them to see in the dark.

#### Classification and Origin

* Acromantulas were first classified by the Ministry of Magic as Dangerous Beasts, marking them as highly dangerous creatures that cannot be domesticated or safely interacted with.
* Originally bred by Dark wizards for the purpose of guarding treasures or cursed locations, their intelligence makes them formidable, yet their aggressive and territorial nature ensures they are not suitable for such tasks.

#### Characteristics and Venom

* One of the most distinctive traits of Acromantulas is their venomous bite, which holds great value for witches and wizards as a rare and highly sought-after potion ingredient.
* However, their aggressive temperament, coupled with their tendency to cannibalize the bodies of their fallen kin, makes it exceedingly difficult to harvest the venom safely.
* In specialized markets, Acromantula venom can fetch prices as high as 100 Galleons, depending on its rarity and the dangers involved in its acquisition.
