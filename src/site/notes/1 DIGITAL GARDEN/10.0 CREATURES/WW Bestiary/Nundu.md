#### Features

**Cruel Cats.** 
The nundu is a large creature, native to hot tropical jungles that resembles a leopard with the throat of a pufferfish. It moves silently, despite its size, and is considered by some to be one of the most dangerous creatures alive. 

The breath of the nundu is toxic and so potent that it can wipe out entire villages of people. The nundu is extremely hard to subdue, as it is vicious with finely honed instincts. Myths and folklore surround this creature in the regions it resides in, the local residents find the nundu truly terrifying. 

**Puffed Pride.** 
The nundu appears as a sleek jaguar or panther when stalking prey, but if seen or threatened it inhales air to puff up its throat. When enlarged, it gives the effect of a mane, and the nundu resembles a male lion. The deadly toxin that the nundu excretes from its spines can be harvested and used in poisons. 

Not many hunt the nundu due to its ferocity and the fact it provides no edible meat when killed. Only skilled butchers can ascertain which scarce parts of the nundu can be eaten, as even a smallest bite of the wrong part of nundu meat is fatal.
