## Description

Erumpents are large, powerful creatures resembling rhinoceroses, native to Africa, and are known for their thick, nearly impenetrable gray hides and a single, sharp horn on their heads. The most dangerous feature of the Erumpent is its horn, which contains an explosive fluid. 

When the horn pierces any object, the fluid causes it to explode with catastrophic force, making the creature highly dangerous when threatened.
