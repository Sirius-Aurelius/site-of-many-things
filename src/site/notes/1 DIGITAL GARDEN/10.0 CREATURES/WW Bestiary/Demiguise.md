## Description

Demiguises are elusive, magical creatures native to the Far East, known for their remarkable ability to become invisible. They resemble gentle, ape-like beings covered in long, silky silver fur with large, doleful eyes. This fur is highly prized in the wizarding world because it can be woven into Invisibility Cloaks. 

Demiguises possess extraordinary patience and are naturally cautious, often relying on their invisibility to avoid threats. As a result, they are notoriously difficult to spot, even by experienced magizoologists. These creatures are herbivorous and non-aggressive, making them harmless but still incredibly elusive.
