## Description

Blast-Ended Skrewts are bizarre and dangerous magical creatures bred from a hybrid of Manticores and Fire Crabs. They have tough, armored shells and are capable of shooting jets of fire or explosive blasts from their rear ends, making them highly unpredictable. 

Skrewts can vary greatly in size, but they are generally aggressive and difficult to handle. Despite their odd appearance and volatile nature, they became infamous when Hagrid introduced them at Hogwarts during a Care of Magical Creatures lesson. 

Their fiery explosions make them hazardous to approach, earning them a reputation as one of the most troublesome magical creatures.
