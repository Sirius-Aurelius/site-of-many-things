## Description

>*"The dementor is among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them... Get too near a dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you."*

Dementors are among the most fearsome and loathsome creatures in the magical world. They are dark entities that embody despair, feeding on human happiness and leaving victims in a state of cold hopelessness.

#### Physical Characteristics and Abilities

* **Dark Entities:** Cloaked in tattered black robes.
* **Glide Through Air:** Seemingly unaffected by gravity.
* **Emotional Drain:** Feed on human happiness, drawing warmth and light.
* **Dementor's Kiss:** Sucks out the soul, leaving an empty, living body.

#### Effects on Victims

* **Deep Sorrow and Fear:** Induce feelings of despair, loneliness, and fear.
* **Memory Loss:** Prolonged exposure leads to loss of good memories, leaving only the worst.
* **Emotional Devastation:** Can reduce a wizard or witch to a state of emotional and mental devastation.

#### Countermeasures

* **Patronus Charm:** The only known defense against a Dementor.
* **Summoning a Patronus:** An advanced spell that summons a protective entity of positive energy.
* **Happy Memories:** The Patronus is a manifestation of the caster's happiest memory.
* **Emotional Resilience:** Key to maintaining the Patronus and resisting the Dementor's influence.

#### Magical Significance and Danger

* **Guards of Azkaban:** Historically used as prison guards, though this is widely criticized.
* **Powerful Threat:** Their presence is a significant danger to emotional and mental well-being.
* **Hope as Defense:** Where there is a Dementor, hope must shine brighter.

## Features

#### Dark Entities

* Dementors are believed to be formed from the negative emotions of humans, much like poltergeists.
* Dementors grow like fungi in dark places filled with decay.
* Large groups of them will be surrounded by a freezing mist that rolls across the countryside like fog, affecting entire populations with their negative energy.
* Because dementors are not truly alive, they cannot be forcibly destroyed or killed. A dementor can be driven to flee through spells like the Patronus Charm, but given time, it will eventually gather its strength back.

#### Depression Manifested

* A dementor is best described as depression in a corporeal form. Its very presence drains the warmth and happiness out of anyone unfortunate enough to cross its path, filling them with despair and forcing them to relive their worst memories.
* This same aura pulls warmth from the air, causing frost to collect on surfaces and nearby water to freeze.
* Prolonged exposure to a dementor often drives a victim insane. This made dementors extremely effective guards in Azkaban prison, destroying any hope of escape among the inmates.
* Dementors are blind, but they can sense the emotions of people around them. They seem to be naturally drawn to individuals who have experienced great suffering or some kind of trauma in their lives.
* This sense doesn't work very well on animals, which would feel less human, less complex and less appealing.
* Muggles cannot see dementors, but still suffer their effects and are threatened by them.
* Spending time away from a dementor is enough to cure an individual of these negative effects, but eating chocolate is a fast-acting remedy. The chocolate clears the victim's head and returns warmth to their limbs.

#### Soul Eaters

* If dementors relish fear and suffering, the ultimate prize is the consumption of a human soul. If it wishes, a dementor can latch its mouth onto a victim's and suck out that person's soul. Known as the Dementor's Kiss, this leaves the victim in a state "worse than death," an empty shell of a body with no sense of self.
* Little is known about the true impact of such a loss, but there is no chance of recovery.
* When promised suffering and souls, dementors will cooperate and follow orders. No matter how obedient they may appear, they always act in their own self-interest. They do not care who is the victim and will gladly drain the emotions or soul from anyone readily available.

#### Amortal Nature

* A dementor doesn't require air, drink, or sleep.
* Being starved of human emotions for an extended period may cause a dementor to be unmade, but this has never been witnessed first hand.
* It's also been speculated that reducing the amount of negative emotion in the world will thin the dementors' numbers. At the very least, this limits the conditions which allow them to multiply, but dementors always seem to form, given enough time.
