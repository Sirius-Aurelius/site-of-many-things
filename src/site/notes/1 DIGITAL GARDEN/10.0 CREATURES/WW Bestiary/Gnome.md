## Description

Gnomes are small, mischievous creatures commonly found in wizarding gardens, where they burrow and cause havoc among plants. Unlike the ornamental gnomes seen in Muggle gardens, magical gnomes are squat, potato-headed creatures with knobbly features, sharp little teeth, and a tendency to wreak disorder.

#### Physical Characteristics and Behavior

* Small, squat, potato-headed creatures.

#### Wizarding Interactions
