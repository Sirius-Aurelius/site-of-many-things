## Description

Gnomes are small, mischievous creatures commonly found in wizarding gardens, where they burrow and cause havoc among plants. Unlike the ornamental gnomes seen in Muggle gardens, magical gnomes are squat, potato-headed creatures with knobbly features, sharp little teeth, and a tendency to wreak disorder.

#### Physical Characteristics and Behavior

* Small, squat, potato-headed creatures.
* Knobbly features and sharp little teeth.
* Burrow and cause havoc among plants.
* Tend to wreak disorder in gardens.
* Stubborn and have a surprisingly strong bite.

#### Wizarding Interactions

* Considered pests by most witches and wizards.
* "De-gnoming" is used to control them (catching and throwing over garden walls).
* More of an annoyance than a true threat.
* Curious fixture in wizarding households with large gardens.
