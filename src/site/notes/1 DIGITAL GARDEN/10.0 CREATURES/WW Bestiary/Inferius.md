## Description

Inferii are reanimated corpses controlled by dark wizards, typically through dark magic. They are not living beings but rather animated puppets used for malevolent purposes.

#### Characteristics and Nature

* **Reanimated Corpses:** Dead bodies brought back to a semblance of movement through dark magic.
* **Controlled by Dark Wizards:** Act as puppets, following the commands of their animator.
* **Not Living Beings:** Lack independent thought, feeling, or life force.
* **Appearance:** Often decayed and waterlogged, with pale, translucent skin and empty, white eyes.

#### Abilities and Vulnerabilities

* **Strength in Numbers:** Though individually weak, they are dangerous in large groups.
* **Vulnerable to Fire:** Fire is one of the few things that can effectively destroy them, as they are susceptible to its destructive power.
* **Magical Control:** Their movements and actions are dictated by the dark wizard who animated them.

#### Magical Significance and Danger

* **Dark Magic:** Created and controlled through highly advanced dark magic.
* **Guarding Dark Objects:** Often used to guard dark objects and locations, such as Horcruxes.
* **Threat to Wizards and Muggles:** Pose a significant threat due to their relentless nature and ability to overwhelm.
* **Fear and Despair:** Their presence instills fear and despair, as they are a manifestation of dark magic's power over death.
