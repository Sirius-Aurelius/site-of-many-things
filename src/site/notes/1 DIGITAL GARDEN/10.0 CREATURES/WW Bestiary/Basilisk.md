## Description

Basilisks are among the most terrifying and deadly creatures in the wizarding world, known for their ability to kill with a single glance. Often referred to as the “King of Serpents,” a basilisk can grow to an enormous length, with some documented to have reached up to fifty feet. Its smooth, dark green scales provide natural camouflage in the shadows, and its yellow eyes are infamous for their deadly gaze. 

Anyone who looks directly into a basilisk’s eyes will be instantly killed, while indirect contact, such as seeing the reflection of its gaze, results in petrification—a state of paralysis that can only be cured with a Mandrake restorative draught. This lethal power makes the basilisk one of the most feared magical creatures, and it is classified as a deadly-level threat by the Ministry of Magic.

## Origin and Creation

![Basilisk Excerpt.png|left|300](/img/user/1%20DIGITAL%20GARDEN/10.0%20CREATURES/(Attachments)/WW%20Bestiary/Basilisk%20Excerpt.png)
* Basilisks are not naturally occurring creatures; they are created through dark and ancient magic.
* Breeding a basilisk requires a chicken egg to be hatched under a toad, a method that has been outlawed for centuries due to the creature’s extreme danger.
* Basilisks are also extremely long-lived, with some recorded to live for hundreds of years if left undisturbed.

## Notable Instances

* One of the most infamous basilisks was controlled by Salazar Slytherin, who hid the creature within the Chamber of Secrets at Hogwarts.
* Through his descendants, the basilisk was commanded by Parselmouths, wizards who possess the rare ability to speak to snakes. Its purpose was to rid the school of Muggle-born students, in line with Slytherin’s beliefs in blood purity.

## Deadly Attributes

* In addition to its deadly eyes, the basilisk’s fangs contain a highly potent venom, which is one of the few known substances capable of destroying a Horcrux.
* The venom is so corrosive that it can cause fatal damage even after the basilisk’s death.
* The only known antidote to basilisk venom is phoenix tears, making it nearly impossible to survive a bite from this creature under normal circumstances.
* Basilisks are among the rarest of magical creatures, as their creation is strictly forbidden and their destructive power makes them a significant threat to both the magical and non-magical world alike.
