## Description

Fire Crabs are magical creatures native to the tropical beaches of Fiji. They resemble large tortoises with jewel-encrusted shells. While their stunning shells make them a target for poachers, Fire Crabs are far from defenseless. They can shoot powerful jets of flame from their rear when threatened, making them highly dangerous to approach without proper protection.
