Meanwhile, the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.2 Factions/07.2.12 Ministry of Magic\|Ministry of Magic]] was divided; Whilst [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Hector Fawley, Minister of Magic\|Hector Fawley, Minister of Magic]] espoused non-intervention, scheming elements of his Privy Council sought to bribe, threaten or otherwise influence muggle events. |

He is suprisingly forthcoming, having perhaps realised he cannot carry all of the weight he does alone. They learn that he has had a difficult start at Hogwarts, with the faculty resenting his [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.2 Factions/07.2.12 Ministry of Magic\|Ministry of Magic]] associations. He is an Investigator in the Department of Mysteries, tasked with - amongst other things - attending to the Hall of Prophecy. The ministry sought volunteers to embed themselves at Hogwarts to prevent strong young wizards 'going dark'. Given his desire to investigate [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Septimus Finch\|Septimus Finch]]'s disappearance, he took the role.                             |
| [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/9.0 Chronicles/Session 05 - Trouble at the Mine\|Session 05 - Trouble at the Mine]]                         | As [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] aid [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Jackdaw Finch\|Jackdaw Finch]] in preventing the escape of any of the muggle soldiers (whilst also stopping [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Kiko\|Kiko]] from doing anything else crazy), Jackdaw tweaks the memories of the survivors and sends them on their way. He then disapparates to report the incident to the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.2 Factions/07.2.12 Ministry of Magic\|Ministry of Magic]], despite [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]]'s attempts to persuade him to... tidy up... by other means.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The power that witches and wizards draw through their wands is inherent in nture, and emanates especially strongly from certain locations. [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.4 Hogwarts Valley/8.4.0 Hogwarts Valley - Overview\|Hogwarts Valley]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.1 Diagon Alley/8.01 Diagon Alley Overview\|Diagon Alley]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.5 Wider World/8.5.0 General Locations/8.5.0.02 Godric's Hollow\|Godric's Hollow]] and the site of the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.2 Factions/07.2.12 Ministry of Magic\|Ministry of Magic]] are all examples of this. This magic is ancient and raw. Wandlore allows witches & wizards to control it, whilst other magic beings ([[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/10.0 CREATURES/5e Bestiary/Goblin\|Goblin]]s, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/10.0 CREATURES/WW Bestiary/Centaur\|Centaur]]s, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/10.0 CREATURES/WW Bestiary/House-Elf\|House Elves]] and the like) have to embrace it in its rawer more natural state                                                                                   |

Jackdaw explains that he is 'smoothing things over. Speak to no one on your way back to the castle'. With which, the party returns stealthily to the safety of the School grounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
