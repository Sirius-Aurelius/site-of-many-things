Meanwhile, the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.2 Factions/07.2.12 Ministry of Magic\|Ministry of Magic]] was divided; Whilst [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Hector Fawley, Minister of Magic\|Hector Fawley, Minister of Magic]] espoused non-intervention, scheming elements of his Privy Council sought to bribe, threaten or otherwise influence muggle events. |
| [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/9.0 Chronicles/Session 04 - Voices from Elsewhere\|Session 04 - Voices from Elsewhere]]                     | [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] have an opportunity to question [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Jackdaw Finch\|Jackdaw Finch]]. He is suprisingly forthcoming, having perhaps realised he cannot carry all of the weight he does alone. They learn that he has had a difficult start at Hogwarts, with the faculty resenting his [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.2 Factions/07.2.12 Ministry of Magic\|Ministry of Magic]] associations. He is an Investigator in the Department of Mysteries, tasked with - amongst other things - attending to the Hall of Prophecy. The ministry sought volunteers to embed themselves at Hogwarts to prevent strong young wizards 'going dark'. Given his desire to investigate [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Septimus Finch\|Septimus Finch]]'s disappearance, he took the role.                             |
| [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/9.0 Chronicles/Session 05 - Trouble at the Mine\|Session 05 - Trouble at the Mine]]                         | As [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] aid [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Jackdaw Finch\|Jackdaw Finch]] in preventing the escape of any of the muggle soldiers (whilst also stopping [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Kiko\|Kiko]] from doing anything else crazy), Jackdaw tweaks the memories of the survivors and sends them on their way. He then disapparates to report the incident to the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.2 Factions/07.2.12 Ministry of Magic\|Ministry of Magic]], despite [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]]'s attempts to persuade him to... tidy up... by other means.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
