- **Appearance:** Quiet and scholarly, with a perpetually thoughtful expression. He has a precise way of speaking and carries a faint scent of parchment and old ink. He's surprisingly spry for his age.
    
- **Personality:** An intellectual polymath, Professor Clutterbuck is fascinated by the underlying structures of magic, whether in ancient runes or complex arithmantic calculations. He's a patient and thorough teacher, but can get lost in arcane details. He believes that understanding magic on a fundamental level is the key to true power and innovation. 
    
- **Gossip:** "Professor Clutterbuck once translated a curse that made the school bell chime backwards for a week." "He spends his summers on archaeological digs in forgotten magical ruins." "He says all magic can be broken down into numbers and symbols." "He is distantly related to the Riddle family (Tom Riddle's Muggle side)."
