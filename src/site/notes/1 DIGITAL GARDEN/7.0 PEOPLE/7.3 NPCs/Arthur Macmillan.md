# Description

Arthur is a loud and enthusiastic boy with an infectious laugh and a constant desire to be the best at whatever he's doing. He comes from a long line of pureblood wizards known for their Quidditch prowess, and Arthur already dreams of being a Gryffindor Seeker. He's incredibly competitive but always remains a good sport, respecting fair play. He can sometimes be a bit of a show-off but has a genuinely kind heart and a fierce loyalty to his friends.
