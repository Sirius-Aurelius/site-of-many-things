- **Appearance:** Muscular and confident, with a perpetual grin and dishevelled brown hair. He's often got a slight scrape or bruise from his latest adventure or Quidditch practice.
    
- **Personality:** The archetypal Gryffindor: brave, daring, and sometimes a little reckless. He's a natural leader (or at least, he _thinks_ he is) and always up for a challenge. He's fiercely loyal to his friends but can be stubborn and quick to anger when he perceives injustice. He's a decent Quidditch player.
    
- **Gossip:** "Leo's always trying to sneak into the Forbidden Forest after dark." "He almost got expelled for charming all the suits of armour to dance the can-can in the Great Hall." "He's obsessed with finding the Chamber of Secrets, even after it was 'found'."
