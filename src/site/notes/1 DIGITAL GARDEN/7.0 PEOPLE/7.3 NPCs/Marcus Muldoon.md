# Description

Marcus is a self-assured and often arrogant boy, accustomed to getting his way. He comes from a wealthy pureblood family (his father, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Ulfric Muldoon\|Ulfric Muldoon]] is the editor of The Daily Prophet) and isn't shy about flaunting his status or inherited talents, particularly in broomstick flying. He possesses a certain natural charm when he wants to, but his entitlement can quickly turn into petulance or aggression if challenged. He's resourceful when it benefits him, capable of finding creative (and sometimes dubious) ways to achieve his goals.
