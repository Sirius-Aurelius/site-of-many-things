# Description

**Appearance:** Dressed in elaborate, feathered Elizabethan-style ruff and velvet doublet, often in shades of grey or black. He's easily recognizable by his "nearly" severed head, which flops oddly on his shoulders, still connected by a single, grisly sinew. He shimmers with a pearly, translucent glow characteristic of ghosts.

**Personality:** Vain, easily offended, and intensely preoccupied with his social standing and reputation. Nick constantly laments his "nearly" headless status, believing it prevents him from joining the truly Headless Hunt. He is proud of his association with Gryffindor House and views himself as a protector and guide for its students. He can be melodramatic and attention-seeking, but beneath the theatrics, he genuinely cares for the students and the well-being of Hogwarts. He loves to tell stories of his life and death, often in excruciating detail.

**Gossip:** "Nearly Headless Nick always complains about not being fully headless." "He throws the best deathday parties." "He's always trying to give advice, whether you want it or not." "He knows all the shortcuts and secret passages in the castle." "I heard he died because he tried to give a witch straightened teeth and it went horribly wrong."
