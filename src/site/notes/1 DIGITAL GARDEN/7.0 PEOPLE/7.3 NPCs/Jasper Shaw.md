# Description

Jasper is a dreamer with a mop of unruly hair and an imagination that often runs wild. He sees connections and patterns that others miss, often leading to brilliant, if sometimes impractical, ideas. He's easily distracted by interesting phenomena and can spend hours observing something others find mundane. He enjoys experimenting, particularly with minor charms and potions, though his results are unpredictable. He often speaks in riddles or tangential thoughts, making him difficult to follow but often insightful.
