# Description

Tommy is a bright-eyed boy with an insatiable curiosity and an adventurous spirit. He's always the first to suggest exploring a forbidden corridor or investigating a strange noise. He means well but can sometimes get carried away by his desire for excitement, inadvertently causing minor chaos. He comes from a Muggle-born family who are fascinated by the magical world, and Tommy tries to learn everything he can about it.
