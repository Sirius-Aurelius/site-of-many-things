# Description

**Appearance:** A tall, beautiful ghost with a mournful expression. She shimmers with a translucent, silvery glow, and her long dark hair flows around her. She often wears flowing robes, looking distant and ethereal.

**Personality:** Reserved, ethereal, and often melancholic. Helena is exceptionally intelligent, but also proud and deeply regretful. She is hesitant to speak of her past and can be quite guarded, only truly opening up when she senses genuine empathy or a desperate need for knowledge that she alone possesses. She is a fount of knowledge, particularly about lost objects and the history of Hogwarts.

- **Gossip:** "The Grey Lady is super smart; she knows everything about the castle." "She's really sad, like, all the time." "Don't ask her about her past; she gets really quiet." "She's one of the few ghosts who can actually be helpful if you catch her on a good day." "I heard she has something to do with the Ravenclaw diadem."
