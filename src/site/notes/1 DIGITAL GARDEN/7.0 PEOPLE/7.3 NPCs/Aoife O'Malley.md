# Description

Aoife is the eldest O'Malley still at Hogwarts, a steady and sensible presence who often feels the weight of responsibility for her younger siblings. She's not outwardly boisterous as her flame red hair might suggest, but possesses a quiet strength and deep empathy, often being the one others come to for advice. Despite their family's humble means, she maintains a dignified composure and excels academically, particularly in Transfiguration, hoping to use her skills to better their family's future.
