# Description

Fanny is a bright-eyed girl with a serious demeanor for her age and an insatiable thirst for knowledge. She loves solving puzzles and riddles, often spending her free time in the library. She comes from a wizarding family known for their academic achievements, and she feels a quiet pressure to live up to their reputation. While not overtly social, she appreciates intelligent conversation and a good debate. She can sometimes be a bit of a know-it-all, but it comes from a genuine desire to understand and share information.
