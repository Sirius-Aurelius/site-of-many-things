# Description

From player back story:
> The gruff fishmonger Cassie charms for food.

>_...Charmed by her earnest sympathy and perhaps utterly bewildered by her appearance just as he was most frustrated, Mr. Grubb, to his own later bewilderment, grumbled, "Well, I suppose it's better than leaving 'em to rot in the gutter, eh? Fine, girl, take 'em. Get 'em out of my sight. Don't want no bad luck lingering." He waved a dismissive hand, practically giving her the mud-splattered cod for free, just to get rid of the "unlucky" lot. A quick cleaning charm from Gran Nell later, and the Weasleys had fish stew for days._
