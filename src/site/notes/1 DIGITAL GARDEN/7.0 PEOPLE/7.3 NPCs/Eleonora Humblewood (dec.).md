# Details
- The tragic figure who saw the past and the future all at once and fell into madness and loneliness either because of, or in spite of, her blessed curse.
- If Basil's visions were true, her crypt lies - morbidly - beneath the school itself ([[Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt\|Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt]])

This is [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)\|Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)]], both blessed and cursed with gifts like Basil's. He sees her scrawling scenes like those he himself witnessed earlier in this vision and he witnesses a slow descent into isolation and some might say madness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

In a voice full of ancient sorrow she tells him: _"They did not listen... but it all came true. All of it. "Seek not to understand the future. In front lies madness.
