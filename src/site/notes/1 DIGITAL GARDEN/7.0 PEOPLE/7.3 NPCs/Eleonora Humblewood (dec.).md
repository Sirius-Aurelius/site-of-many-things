# Details
- The tragic figure who saw the past and the future all at once and fell into madness and loneliness either because of, or in spite of, her blessed curse.
- If Basil's visions were true, her crypt lies - morbidly - beneath the school itself ([[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.03 Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt\|8.5.03 Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt]])

This is [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)\|Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)]], both blessed and cursed with gifts like Basil's. He sees her scrawling scenes like those he himself witnessed earlier in this vision and he witnesses a slow descent into isolation and some might say madness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Basil shares an extraordinary vision of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/The Fat Friar\|The Fat Friar]]'s death, executed after a long imprisonment by his fellow monks.

This is what caused [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)\|Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)]] to fall into madness and is why [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/The Fat Friar\|The Fat Friar]] fears for [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]]                                                                                                      |
