- **Appearance:** Bright-eyed and earnest, usually with ink smudges on her cheek. Always wears her uniform neatly, but it often looks a bit rumpled from her latest project.

- **Personality:** The epitome of a keen, slightly overwhelmed Hufflepuff. She's incredibly diligent, especially in Herbology and Charms, and genuinely believes in doing her best. She's a bit of a worrier and tries to be helpful to everyone, sometimes to her own detriment. She values fairness above all else.

- **Gossip:** "Penny spends all her free time in the greenhouses, she practically lives there." "Heard she's trying to cross-breed a Puffskein with a Mandrake â€“ hope she doesn't blow up the greenhouse!" "She's always getting stuck helping people with their homework, even when she's swamped herself."
