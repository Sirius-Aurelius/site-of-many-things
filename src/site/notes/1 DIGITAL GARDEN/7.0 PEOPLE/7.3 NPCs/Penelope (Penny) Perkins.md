>[!info] 
>**Role**:: Hufflepuff student (1st year in 1939)
>**ThreeWordSummary**:: Bright-eyed, worrier, Herbology-obsessed
>**UsuallyFoundIn**:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.3.01 Hufflepuff Tower\|Hufflepuff Tower]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.2.01 Herbology Greenhouses\|Herbology Greenhouses]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.2.05 Charms Classroom\|Charms classroom]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.3.01.01 Hufflepuff Common Room\|Hufflepuff Common Room]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.3.01.02 Hufflepuff Dormitories\|Hufflepuff Dormitories]]

- **Appearance:** Bright-eyed and earnest, usually with ink smudges on her cheek. Always wears her uniform neatly, but it often looks a bit rumpled from her latest project.

- **Personality:** The epitome of a keen, slightly overwhelmed Hufflepuff. She's incredibly diligent, especially in Herbology and Charms, and genuinely believes in doing her best. She's a bit of a worrier and tries to be helpful to everyone, sometimes to her own detriment. She values fairness above all else.

- **Gossip:** "Penny spends all her free time in the greenhouses, she practically lives there." "Heard she's trying to cross-breed a Puffskein with a Mandrake â€“ hope she doesn't blow up the greenhouse!" "She's always getting stuck helping people with their homework, even when she's swamped herself."

## Canon
- She studiously - obsessively - notetakes, with no form of shorthand or editing. She sometimes even writes overheard interruptions
