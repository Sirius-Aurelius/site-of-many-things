- **Appearance:** Quiet and unassuming, often blending into the background. She has sharp, calculating eyes that miss nothing.
    
- **Personality:** Serena is not outwardly aggressive like many Slytherins, but she's incredibly observant and has a talent for gathering information. She prefers to work from the shadows, manipulating events and people with subtle nudges rather than overt force. She's fiercely protective of her own interests and those she considers "useful" allies. She has a deep understanding of social dynamics and power structures.
    
- **Gossip:** "Serena knows everything that goes on in this school, it's creepy." "She's always listening in on conversations, pretending to read a book." "I heard she's got a list of everyone's secrets."
