- **Appearance:** Reserved and neatly dressed, with sharp, observant eyes behind a pair of spectacles. He carries a thick, leather-bound notebook everywhere.
    
- **Personality:** Highly intelligent, analytical, and a meticulous planner. Elias is fascinated by ancient runes, obscure magical theories, and complex enchantments. He values knowledge above all else and can be dismissive of those he deems less intellectually rigorous. He's not unfriendly, but he struggles with social graces and often comes across as blunt or arrogant.
    
- **Gossip:** "Elias knows everything about everything, it's actually annoying." "He's probably already started working on his N.E.W.T.s." "He spends all his time in the library, even the librarians are scared of how much he reads."
