>**Role**:: Caretaker at [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.2.0 Hogwarts School - Overview\|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry]]
>**ThreeWordSummary**:: Gruff, sour, meticulous
>**UsuallyFoundIn**:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.4.06 Caretaker's Office\|Caretaker's Office]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.4.03.1 School Library - Open Section\|School Library (open section)]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.4.03.2 School Library - Restricted Section\|School Library (restricted section)]]

- **Appearance:** A gruff, grizzled wizard with a perpetually sour expression, a bristly grey moustache, and a worn, patched set of robes. He carries a large ring of ancient keys that jingle loudly.
    
- **Personality:** Grumbling, meticulous, and utterly devoted to the cleanliness and order of Hogwarts, even if he despises the students who constantly disrupt it. Reggie knows every secret passage, every creaky floorboard, and every hidden nook of the castle. He's a master of cleaning charms and warding off vermin, magical or otherwise. He has a surprisingly soft spot for old, forgotten magical artifacts and keeps a collection of them in his office. He's fiercely loyal to the school itself, if not its occupants.
    
- **Gossip:** "Reggie can tell who's been out of bed just by the dust on the floor." "He's got a map of the entire castle in his head." "He's always complaining about Peeves, but I think he secretly enjoys the chase." "He keeps talking to the gargoyles."
