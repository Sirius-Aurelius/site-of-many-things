# Details

## Description
>*Sophomora is a sturdy witch in her late 40s or early 50s, with a **weather-beaten but kind face**. Her dark, practical robes are often dusted with soil or leaves, typically worn with a thick, leather apron. Her hands are strong and calloused from years of working the land, and her grey-streaked hair is usually braided or tied back with a piece of twine, sometimes adorned with a vibrant, freshly picked magical flower from the grounds. She carries a surprisingly **small, intricate keyring** on her belt, which seems to hold far more keys than physically possible, each subtly labelled or magically distinct.*

## Notes

### Role and Overview

Sophomora Meadowsweet serves as Hogwarts' **Keeper of Grounds and Keys**. Her responsibilities encompass the maintenance and magical upkeep of the castle's exterior, pathways, courtyards, and various outbuildings. She also manages the extensive collection of keys for countless doors, gates, and storage areas across the school and its surrounding property. Her role complements [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Reginald (Reggie) Cattermole\|Reginald (Reggie) Cattermole]], the Caretaker, who primarily focuses on the castle's interior, and [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Silvanus Kettleburn\|Silvanus Kettleburn]], the Care of Magical Creatures Professor, who is concerned with the welfare and study of magical beasts.

### Appearance

Sophomora is a sturdy witch in her late 40s or early 50s, with a **weather-beaten but kind face**. Her dark, practical robes are often dusted with soil or leaves, typically worn with a thick, leather apron. Her hands are strong and calloused from years of working the land, and her grey-streaked hair is usually braided or tied back with a piece of twine, sometimes adorned with a vibrant, freshly picked magical flower from the grounds. She carries a surprisingly **small, intricate keyring** on her belt, which seems to hold far more keys than physically possible, each subtly labelled or magically distinct.

### Personality

Quietly observant and deeply attuned to the **natural magic of Hogwarts**, Sophomora is a woman of few words, preferring her actions to speak for her. She may appear gruff or distracted to students, but she possesses a deep, almost maternal, protectiveness for the castle and its inhabitants. She embodies Hufflepuff values of **hard work, patience, and a deep connection to the community**. She appreciates consistency, meticulousness, and the subtle rhythms of nature. Her dry, understated sense of humour only surfaces on rare occasions, often in response to particularly daft student antics or Peeves's more predictable pranks.

### Relationships with Other NPCs

- **Reginald Cattermole (Caretaker):** Sophomora and Reggie maintain a professional understanding, often exchanging gruff nods. They share an unspoken rivalry of meticulousness; Elara might occasionally leave a mysteriously weeded path for Reggie, or he a perfectly swept corridor for her, each knowing the other notices and appreciates the effort.
- **Silvanus Kettleburn (Care of Magical Creatures Professor):** Sophomora holds a grudging respect for Kettleburn's passion for creatures, but frequently finds herself tidying up after his more "enthusiastic" creature lessons spill onto the grounds. She might leave him a note or a strategically placed barrier where a group of Puffskeins or a stray Billywig has escaped.
- **Hogwarts House-Elves:** She maintains an excellent relationship with the House-Elves, treating them with immense respect, a trait common among Hufflepuffs. They often provide her with strong, simple charms for groundskeeping or discreetly alert her to strange magical occurrences on the property, trusting her to understand the castle's subtle languages.
- **Peeves the Poltergeist:** Sophomora often anticipates Peeves' outdoor pranks and subtly neutralizes them before they fully manifest. She might use a quiet charm or arrange a "convenient accident" that sees his bucket of green slime disappear before it can be tipped. Peeves finds her "boring" but frustratingly effective, often grumbling about her "spoil-sport ways".

### Skills and Abilities

- **Herbology (Intelligence/Wisdom):** Sophomora possesses expert knowledge of the magical plants that grow on Hogwarts grounds, allowing her to identify both beneficial flora and potential nuisances. She knows where to find ingredients for remedies like Star Grass Salve and can manage sudden magical plant growths.
- **Magical Creatures (Wisdom):** While not a Magizoologist, she has a practical understanding of mundane and common "pest" creatures, such as Gnomes, Horklumps, or Chizpurfles, and the best ways to deter them from the grounds without harming them.
- **Practical Charms (Charms School):** She is proficient in low-level charms for maintenance, warding, and minor repairs. Examples include **Tergeo (The Siphoning Charm)** for cleaning, **Pereo (The Extinguishing Charm)** for small fires, and **Alohomora (The Unlocking Charm)** or **Colloportus (The Locking Spell)** for her many doors and gates. She also knows **Repello Muggletum**, a 4th-level Charm ritual, to keep the Muggle world from encroaching on Hogwarts.
- **Castle Whisperer (Innate Trait):** Sophomora has an almost instinctual connection to the castle's ancient magic. She can often "feel" shifts in the castle's wards or sense when an area is magically disturbed, even if no obvious spell is cast.
