# Description

**Appearance:** A gaunt, terrifying ghost, shimmering with a silvery sheen that is often tinged with the red of dried blood. He wears shackles on his wrists and ankles and is clad in tattered, blood-stained robes. His eyes are hollow and sunken, and his face often carries an expression of cold fury or deep sorrow.

**Personality:** Stern, unforgiving, and prone to sudden, violent outbursts of temper. The Bloody Baron is the most feared of the Hogwarts ghosts, even by the staff. He rarely speaks and when he does, his voice is a rasping whisper that sends shivers down spines. He commands respect and fear, particularly from the students of Slytherin House, whom he oversees. He is burdened by immense guilt and remorse, which manifests in his melancholic and brooding demeanor.

**Gossip:** "Don't ever cross the Bloody Baron; he's absolutely terrifying." "He's the only one Peeves is actually scared of." "I heard he murdered someone when he was alive, that's why he's covered in blood." "He never speaks to anyone, just glides around looking miserable." "If you ever see him looking particularly red, stay far, far away."
