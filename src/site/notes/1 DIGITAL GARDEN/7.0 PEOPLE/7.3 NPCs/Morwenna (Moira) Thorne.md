Healing isn’t always about mending bones, my love. Sometimes it’s about lifting a spirit. There is a simple but wonderfully effective charm I want you to learn: the Cheering Charm, **[[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Exhilaro\|Exhilaro]]**. "The incantation is straightforward, and the wand movement is a gentle, uplifting flick. The key is intent. A simple desire to bring a moment of joy will make a person feel cheerful and give them heart against their fears. But if you concentrate, if you channel a truly happy memory—much like aurors do for a Patronus—the effect is far more potent. It can send the target into incapacitating fits of laughter. It is a fine charm to practice, though perhaps try it on a cushion before you try it on Plop. And remember your potions; should you ever overdo it, a simple [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/4.0 Potions/Draught of Peace\|Draught of Peace]] is the perfect counteragent!"* |
