In a brief moment where they were both connected to the stone, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] shares a memory of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] as a child with a grazed knee being administered [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/4.0 Potions/Star Grass Salve\|Star Grass Salve]] by her mother, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Morwenna (Moira) Thorne\|Morwenna (Moira) Thorne]].

She also finds a large stack of seemingly coded papers, taking a random sample of 12 for future use or investigation. Drawing this to [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]]'s attention, Vi gathers up 10 further papers from the collection of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Septimus Finch\|Septimus Finch]] on various herbological and alchemical subjects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Healing isn’t always about mending bones, my love. Sometimes it’s about lifting a spirit. There is a simple but wonderfully effective charm I want you to learn: the Cheering Charm, **[[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Exhilaro\|Exhilaro]]**. "The incantation is straightforward, and the wand movement is a gentle, uplifting flick. The key is intent. A simple desire to bring a moment of joy will make a person feel cheerful and give them heart against their fears. But if you concentrate, if you channel a truly happy memory—much like aurors do for a Patronus—the effect is far more potent. It can send the target into incapacitating fits of laughter. It is a fine charm to practice, though perhaps try it on a cushion before you try it on Plop. And remember your potions; should you ever overdo it, a simple [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/4.0 Potions/Draught of Peace\|Draught of Peace]] is the perfect counteragent!"* |
