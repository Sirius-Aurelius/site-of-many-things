**Appearance:** Graceful and serene, often dressed in elegant, flowing robes that evoke the night sky or distant galaxies. Her dark hair is usually intricately braided, and she wears subtle, often astronomical, jewelry. She has sharp, observant eyes that seem to take in everything.

**Personality:** Highly intelligent, methodical, and exceptionally patient. Professor Shah possesses a quiet intensity and a deep reverence for the cosmos. She is an exacting teacher, demanding precision and dedication from her students, but she is also incredibly fair and supportive of genuine effort. She values intellectual curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge above all else. While she might appear reserved, she has a dry wit and a profound sense of wonder that she occasionally shares with her most engaged students. She is deeply committed to the scientific principles of astronomy and often brings a philosophical perspective to her lessons.

**Gossip:** "Professor Shah can tell if you've done your star charts properly just by looking at them from across the room." "She stays up all night in the Astronomy Tower, sometimes just watching the sky." "I heard she solved a complex celestial anomaly that even the Ministry of Magic's astronomers couldn't figure out." "She gives the hardest exams, but if you actually learn the material, you'll ace them." "She once gave a first-year a detention for yawning during a lecture on planetary alignments."
