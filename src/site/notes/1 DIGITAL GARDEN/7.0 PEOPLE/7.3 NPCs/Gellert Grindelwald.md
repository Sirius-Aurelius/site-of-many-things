# Description

Gellert Grindelwald is a powerful and ambitious wizard who believes in the superiority of magical folk over Muggles. As a brilliant student at Durmstrang Institute, he's expelled for "twisted experiments." In his youth, he forms a close friendship with [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Albus Dumbledore\|Albus Dumbledore]]. Together, they seek the Deathly Hallows and debate how to reform the wizarding world. Their friendship ends tragically after a duel involving Dumbledore's brother, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Aberforth Dumbledore\|Aberforth Dumbledore]], which results in the death of their sister, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Ariana Dumbledore (dec.)\|Ariana]].

Following this, Grindelwald embarks on a reign of terror in Europe, seeking to establish a wizarding order where Muggles are subservient. He becomes infamous and attracts a wide following, using the slogan "For the Greater Good" to justify his actions. He steals the Elder Wand, one of the Deathly Hallows, and builds a prison called Nurmengard for his opponents. His rise to power and the resulting global upheaval in the wizarding world are the backdrop for the events of the mid-20th century.

>*His rule ends in 1945 when Albus Dumbledore finally confronts and defeats him in a legendary duel. Grindelwald is then imprisoned in his own fortress, where he remains until he's killed by Voldemort decades later.*
