Most assumed he was lost to some beast but no remains were found and Jackdaw doesn't believe. Septimus was working with Dippett, Slughorn and others to "make the forest safer for wizardkind" (controlling paths, negotiating a centaur treaty etc). They even made some progress placating the goblins who wanted to mine the area for (ancient) magic                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

He is suprisingly forthcoming, having perhaps realised he cannot carry all of the weight he does alone. They learn that he has had a difficult start at Hogwarts, with the faculty resenting his [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.2 Factions/07.2.12 Ministry of Magic\|Ministry of Magic]] associations. He is an Investigator in the Department of Mysteries, tasked with - amongst other things - attending to the Hall of Prophecy. The ministry sought volunteers to embed themselves at Hogwarts to prevent strong young wizards 'going dark'. Given his desire to investigate [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Septimus Finch\|Septimus Finch]]'s disappearance, he took the role. |
