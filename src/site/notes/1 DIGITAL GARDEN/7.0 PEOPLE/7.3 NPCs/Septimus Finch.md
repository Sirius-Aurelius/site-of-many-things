Most assumed he was lost to some beast but no remains were found and Jackdaw doesn't believe. Septimus was working with [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Armando Dippet\|Armando Dippet]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Horace Slughorn\|Horace Slughorn]] and others to "make the forest safer for wizardkind" (controlling paths, negotiating a centaur treaty etc).

He is suprisingly forthcoming, having perhaps realised he cannot carry all of the weight he does alone. They learn that he has had a difficult start at Hogwarts, with the faculty resenting his [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.2 Factions/07.2.12 Ministry of Magic\|Ministry of Magic]] associations. He is an Investigator in the Department of Mysteries, tasked with - amongst other things - attending to the Hall of Prophecy. The ministry sought volunteers to embed themselves at Hogwarts to prevent strong young wizards 'going dark'. Given his desire to investigate [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Septimus Finch\|Septimus Finch]]'s disappearance, he took the role. |
