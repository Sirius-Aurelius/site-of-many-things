- **Appearance:** Impeccably dressed, with sharp, aristocratic features and an air of effortless superiority. He carries himself with a predatory grace.
    
- **Personality:** Charismatic, ambitious, and incredibly cunning. Cassian comes from a long line of pure-blood wizards and carries the weight of his family's reputation (and expectations) with him. He's a natural leader within Slytherin, skilled at manipulation and strategy. He values power, influence, and purity of blood, though he's pragmatic enough to know when to use charm over intimidation. He's an excellent Seeker.
    
- **Gossip:** "Cassian probably has half the school in his pocket, one way or another." "He's always lurking near the Headmaster's office, probably trying to eavesdrop." "He cheated on his Potions exam, I just _know_ it."
