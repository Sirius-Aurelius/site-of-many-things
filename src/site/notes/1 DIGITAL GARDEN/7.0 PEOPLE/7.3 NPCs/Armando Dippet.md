>**Role**:: Headteacher of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.2.0 Hogwarts School - Overview\|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry]]
>**ThreeWordSummary**:: Kindly, softly-spoken, seemingly detached

- **Appearance:** A kindly, rather old wizard with a perpetually slightly bewildered expression, a neatly trimmed beard, and often a dusting of snuff on his robes. He exudes an aura of gentle authority, but also a certain academic detachment.
    
- **Personality:** Well-meaning but somewhat ineffectual. Dippet values tradition, decorum, and the smooth running of the school above almost all else. He's easily influenced by strong personalities (like Dumbledore or the Board of Governors) and prefers to avoid confrontation. He genuinely cares for the students' well-being but sometimes misses the forest for the trees. He has a soft spot for impressive family lineages.
    
- **Gossip:** "Dippet almost expelled that Riddle boy, but Dumbledore talked him out of it." "He's always cancelling classes for 'urgent matters' that turn out to be nothing." "They say he's more concerned with the school's reputation than its actual safety." "He's secretly terrified of the Board of Governors, especially the Blacks and Notts."
