# Description

Declan is full of restless energy and boundless curiosity, always eager to explore and learn new things â€“ especially if they involve an element of risk or adventure. He's often got a smudge of dirt on his nose and is prone to getting into minor scrapes due to his inquisitive nature. He idolizes his older siblings, especially Cian and Aoife, and tries his best to keep up. He has an unrefined but potent talent for Dueling Club spells.
