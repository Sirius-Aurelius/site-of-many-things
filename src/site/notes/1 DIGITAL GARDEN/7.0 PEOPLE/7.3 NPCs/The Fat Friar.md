# Description

**Appearance:** A jolly, portly ghost with a perpetually cheerful expression, dressed in a monk's habit. He shimmers with a gentle, benevolent glow and often carries a kindly, reassuring aura. He's notably round and seems to float with a light, airy grace despite his girth.

**Personality:** Good-natured, forgiving, and eternally optimistic. The Fat Friar is known for his compassion and his willingness to give second chances, even to those who might not deserve them. He's incredibly amiable and enjoys helping students. He's a true Hufflepuff, embodying loyalty, hard work, and fairness. He often tries to mediate disputes among other ghosts and has a soft spot for everyone.

**Gossip:** "The Fat Friar is the nicest ghost at Hogwarts, always smiling." "He'll help you find your way if you get lost, especially near the kitchens." "He's always talking about forgiveness, even for Peeves!" "He tries to get the Bloody Baron and Nearly Headless Nick to be friends." "He never says a bad word about anyone."
