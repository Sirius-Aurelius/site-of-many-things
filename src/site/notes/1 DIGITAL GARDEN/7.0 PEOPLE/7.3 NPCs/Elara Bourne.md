>**3 Word Summary**:: Brilliant, logical, high-standards
>**Usually found in**:: [location links here]

- **Appearance:** Elegant and precise, with a sharp, intelligent gaze. Her hair is often pulled back in a severe but stylish bun, and she moves with quiet efficiency.
    
- **Personality:** Brilliant, logical, and a stickler for detail. Professor Bourne believes in rigorous academic pursuit and intellectual honesty. She expects high standards from her students and has little patience for sloppiness or unthinking adherence to tradition. She can appear aloof but deeply cares about fostering true understanding and innovation. She has a dry wit and an unexpected love for complex magical puzzles.
    
- **Gossip:** "Professor Bourne's exams are impossible, she expects you to invent new spells!" "She spends half her evenings in the library's restricted section." "She once made a student rewrite an essay twelve times because of one misplaced comma."
