# Details

## Description
>_Your eyes are immediately drawn to Professor Bourne, who commands attention with an air of elegance and precision. About 40 years of age, she wears dark blue, impeccably tailored robes with subtle bronze accents, a quiet symbol of her authority as Head of Ravenclaw House._ 
>_Her jet black hair is pulled into a severe yet stylish bun, highlighting her sharp features and high cheekbones. Her expression remains neutral, though a flicker of calculation is evident in her piercing grey eyes, as if weighing and evaluating everything around her. Thin, firm-set lips reinforce her composed demeanor._  

### Additional Description
>_Her movements carry a deliberate efficiency, each gesture purposeful and without waste. She stands with perfect posture, radiating authority, and her wand rests in hand as though a natural extension of her will. A faint, crisp scent—like parchment and polished wood—seems to accompany her presence._  
>_An aura of brilliance and strict logic surrounds her, reflecting a mind that values intellectual rigor and high standards. The expectation is clear: carelessness and shallow thinking have no place in her Charms class._

## Notes

- **Appearance:** Elegant and precise, with a sharp, intelligent gaze. Her hair is often pulled back in a severe but stylish bun, and she moves with quiet efficiency.
    
- **Personality:** Brilliant, logical, and a stickler for detail. Professor Bourne believes in rigorous academic pursuit and intellectual honesty. She expects high standards from her students and has little patience for sloppiness or unthinking adherence to tradition. She can appear aloof but deeply cares about fostering true understanding and innovation. She has a dry wit and an unexpected love for complex magical puzzles.
    
- **Gossip:** "Professor Bourne's exams are impossible, she expects you to invent new spells!" "She spends half her evenings in the library's restricted section." "She once made a student rewrite an essay twelve times because of one misplaced comma."
