# Description
**Entering the library to investigate a disturbance**
>The dim light from the corridor is swallowed by a severe, dark figure. Madame Pince; commandant of this intellectual fiefdom.
>Her dark robes flow around her as she glides into the library, and her spectacles glint in the dimness like a predator's eyes. She stands utterly still for a moment, head cocked, listening. Then, with a furious, silent precision, she begins to move, her gaze sweeping over the rows of books like a hungry basilisk searching for its prey. 
>The air suddenly feels nervewrackingly thick and you can feel her cold fury growing with every silent step she takes.

She tells him that the entirety of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.2.0 Hogwarts School - Overview\|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry]] is anti-cartographical. Only the main areas of the school are plottable and even some of them seem resistant to being pinned down. |
