# Description

Lena is a quiet and reserved girl from an old wizarding family with roots in Eastern Europe. She speaks with a slight, almost unnoticeable accent and carries an air of quiet contemplation. She's incredibly analytical, preferring to observe and process information before speaking. She has a deep interest in ancient magical traditions and folklore from around the world, often drawing parallels between different cultures. Her reserved nature can sometimes make her seem aloof, but she is genuinely thoughtful and kind.
