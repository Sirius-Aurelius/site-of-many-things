# Description

Agnes is a quiet, observant student with a surprising knack for herbology. She's a small, unassuming girl with kind eyes and a perpetually slightly-soiled tunic, a testament to her love for plants. She speaks softly but thoughtfully, often offering observations that others might miss. She arrived at Hogwarts from a family of Muggle farmers who were surprised but supportive of her magical abilities. She finds comfort and understanding amongst the plants in the greenhouses.
