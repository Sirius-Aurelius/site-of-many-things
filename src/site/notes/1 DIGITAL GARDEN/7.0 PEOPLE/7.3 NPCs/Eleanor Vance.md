# Description

Eleanor is a meticulous and studious girl with a passion for magical history. She's a neat, precise girl who carries a well-worn copy of "A History of Magic" everywhere she goes. She has an insatiable curiosity about the past and loves to cross-reference facts. Her family are prominent Ministry of Magic officials, and she feels a strong sense of duty to be well-informed. Sheâ€™s not afraid to correct others if they get their facts wrong.
