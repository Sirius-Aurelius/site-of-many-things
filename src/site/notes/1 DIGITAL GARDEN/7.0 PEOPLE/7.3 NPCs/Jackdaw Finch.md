# Details

**Description:** 
>*A figure of both seasoned magic and wartime grit, his face is etched with lines of experience and a confident, almost roguish, smirk, that is framed by a neatly trimmed and upturned mustache. Instead of a traditional wizard's hat, he wears a worn leather flying cap, its straps dangling by his chin, with a pair of antique flying goggles perched on his forehead.*
>*Over a dark blue, long-flowing robe adorned with subtle, medallion-like symbols of arcane rank, he wears a classic, brown leather flight jacket. The sheepskin collar is turned up against the chill, and the jacket itself looks well-loved and lived-in. A broad leather belt cinches his robe at the waist, from which a large buckle gleams.*
>*In one gloved hand, he clutches a gnarled, dark wooden staff, its top branching out to cradle a brilliant, icy-blue crystal that hums with magical energy. In his other hand, he holds a rolled-up scroll, its edges yellowed and its surface bearing the faint lines of an ancient, enchanted map. The faintest ethereal, glowing ring of pale blue light swirls around his head, a subtle crown of power earned in swirling clouds. Here is a man who clearly navigates the skies, not with some newfound muggle "plane" contraption, but with a broomstick and pure, unbridled magic.*
