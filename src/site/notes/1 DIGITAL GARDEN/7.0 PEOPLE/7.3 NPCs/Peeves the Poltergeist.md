# Description

>"_Peeves is the most notorious and troublesome poltergeist in British history. Unlike the overwhelming majority of his colleagues, Peeves has a physical form, though he is able to become invisible at will. His looks reflect his nature, which those who know him would agree is a seamless blend of humour and malice._"

**Peeves** was a poltergeist at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, since c. 993. Fond of mischief and chaos, he was a constant pain to the school and its inhabitants, especially [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Reginald (Reggie) Cattermole\|Reginald (Reggie) Cattermole]], as the only ones able to control him were [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/The Bloody Baron\|The Bloody Baron]] and [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Albus Dumbledore\|Albus Dumbledore]].
