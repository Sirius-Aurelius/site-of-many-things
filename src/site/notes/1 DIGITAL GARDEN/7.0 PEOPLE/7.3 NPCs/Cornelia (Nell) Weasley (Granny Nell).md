# Description

From player back story:
>_Of all her family, Cassie shared a special, unspoken bond with her grandmother, Nell Weasley. Gran Nell, with her wise, crinkled eyes and a scent of dried herbs and fire whiskey about her, was Cassie's confidante and quiet mentor. It was Nell who had knitted the colourful "wandom" that concealed Cassie's powerful elder wood wand â€“ a practical gift to keep attention away from Cassie. Nell had always been the first to understand Cassie's peculiar "feelings" about future events, never dismissing them as childish imagination._
>
>_That's because Gran Nell possessed a quiet, understated gift of her own: the "seeing eye." Not prone to dramatic prophecies or tea-leaf readings, Nell's divination manifested as a subtle, intuitive sense of what was to come, a wisdom that often guided her family through their many trials. She'd "just know" when a certain problem could resolve itself, or when Perseus should "just not bother with that gadget, dear."_
>
>_It was from Nell that Cassie inherited her own uncanny ability to foresee small, mundane events._

>_Gran Nell was the only one Cassie truly trusted with the full extent of her premonitions, often sharing hushed whispers in the dim corners of their tent-home. Her grandmother's knowing nods and gentle guidance taught Cassie how to lean into her gift, even when others might not understand it._
