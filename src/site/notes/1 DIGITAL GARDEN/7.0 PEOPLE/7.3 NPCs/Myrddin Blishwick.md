# Details

## Description
>_Professor Blishwick stands as a figure of quiet power. He is a man of about 50 - seemingly in the prime of his life - with a regal posture and a gaze that holds the weight of countless secrets. His dark hair, streaked with silver at the temples, is meticulously combed back, revealing a high, intelligent forehead.
>He is draped in a magnificent robe of deep indigo and violet. The fabric is not just cloth; it is a tapestry of arcane symbols and swirling patterns that seem to shimmer with an inner light. The sleeves are voluminous, and the collar is high, edged with a silver-threaded trim that continues down the length of the garment. Around his waist is a wide, intricate silver belt, from which hangs a delicate chain. At the center of the belt buckle, a polished gemstone catches the ambient light.
>On his face is an expression of calm resolve. Despite his field of expertise being so often associated with charlatans, he shows no sign of being a man of bluster or showmanship and instead exudes a deep, powerful sense of wisdom._

- **Gossip:**
    
    - "Professor Blishwick knows things before they happen, it's unsettling."
    - "He never gives a straight answer; he always speaks in riddles, especially when you ask him about your future grades."
    - "He's unusually interested in those students who have strange visions or rare magical talents, like Cassie Weasley and Basil Featherstone.".
    - "Sometimes he just stares off into space, then says something completely out of context about an impending war or a looming disaster, even when Headmaster Dippet insists on peace.".
    - "The ghosts of the castle seem to trust him more than anyone else, sometimes even sharing secrets.".
    - "He seems to know _exactly_ what everyone is thinking; it's unnerving, like he's reading your mind without a wand.".

    - "Professor Shah in Astronomy thinks his methods are 'less rigorous', but he probably knew she'd say that anyway.".
