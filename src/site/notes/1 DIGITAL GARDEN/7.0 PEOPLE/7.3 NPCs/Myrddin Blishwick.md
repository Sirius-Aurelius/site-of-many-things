# Details

## Description
>_Professor Blishwick stands as a figure of quiet power. He is a man of about 50 - seemingly in the prime of his life - with a regal posture and a gaze that holds the weight of countless secrets. His dark hair, streaked with silver at the temples, is meticulously combed back, revealing a high, intelligent forehead.
>He is draped in a magnificent robe of deep indigo and violet. The fabric is not just cloth; it is a tapestry of arcane symbols and swirling patterns that seem to shimmer with an inner light. The sleeves are voluminous, and the collar is high, edged with a silver-threaded trim that continues down the length of the garment. Around his waist is a wide, intricate silver belt, from which hangs a delicate chain. At the center of the belt buckle, a polished gemstone catches the ambient light.
>On his face is an expression of calm resolve. Despite his field of expertise being so often associated with charlatans, he shows no sign of being a man of bluster or showmanship and instead exudes a deep, powerful sense of wisdom._
