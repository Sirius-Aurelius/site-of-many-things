- **Appearance:** A sharp, intense witch with severe spectacles and an almost military posture. She carries her wand like a weapon and her robes are always pristine, even after a dueling demonstration.
    
- **Personality:** Disciplined, pragmatic, and highly suspicious of anything that hints at dark magic or ill intent. Professor Blight believes in practical defense and instills a sense of vigilance in her students. She survived a minor skirmish with a dark wizard gang in her youth, leaving her with a deep-seated distrust of shadowy organizations. She can be overly stern but genuinely wants her students to be prepared for the dangers of the world. She has a deep respect for those who show courage and initiative.
    
- **Gossip:** "Professor Blight knows every counter-curse ever invented." "She probably sleeps with her wand under her pillow." "She almost got expelled herself for hexing a Ministry official who questioned her methods." "She's always saying 'constant vigilance!'"
