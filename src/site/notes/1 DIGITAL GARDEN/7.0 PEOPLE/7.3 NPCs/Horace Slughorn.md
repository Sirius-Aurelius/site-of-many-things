# Details

## Description
**In his classroom:**
>A large man is presiding over the scene. Professor Horace Slughorn is a magnificent spectacle, his portly form completely filling the space behind his desk. He is a man who seems to be made of fine materials himselfâ€”a deep plum-colored velvet smoking jacket hangs loosely on his shoulders, its fabric catching the light.
>His face is round and rosy, framed by a luxuriant, silvery-white walrus moustache that seems to have a life of its own. It's so thick and impressive you can't help but stare. A pair of small, glittering eyes twinkle merrily above it, missing nothing.
>As he notices you, a satisfied smirk spreads across his face, pushing his cheeks up into perfect, apple-like rounds. He looks like a man who has just told a very good joke or, more likely, discovered an incredibly rare ingredient for something. He seems entirely pleased with himself and the world.

## Notes
- **Appearance:** Portly and jovial, with a walrus moustache and a penchant for fine robes and accessories. He often has a satisfied smirk.
    
- **Personality:** Charismatic, self-important, and a connoisseur of comfort and connections. Slughorn loves to collect promising students (his "Slug Club") who he believes will go on to achieve greatness and, in turn, be useful to him later. He values talent, influence, and a good pedigree. He's not inherently malicious, but he is a social climber and easily swayed by flattery and prestige. He genuinely enjoys teaching potions and seeing students succeed, as long as it benefits him in some way.
    
- **Gossip:** "Professor Slughorn only invites the 'right' people to his parties." "He'll do anything for a bit of influence." "He gave Cassian Black a perfect Potions grade even though everyone knows he cheated." "He's always fishing for compliments about his rare ingredients."
