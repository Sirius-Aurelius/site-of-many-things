 **Appearance:** Portly and jovial, with a walrus moustache and a penchant for fine robes and accessories. He often has a satisfied smirk.
    
- **Personality:** Charismatic, self-important, and a connoisseur of comfort and connections. Slughorn loves to collect promising students (his "Slug Club") who he believes will go on to achieve greatness and, in turn, be useful to him later. He values talent, influence, and a good pedigree. He's not inherently malicious, but he is a social climber and easily swayed by flattery and prestige. He genuinely enjoys teaching potions and seeing students succeed, as long as it benefits him in some way.
    
- **Gossip:** "Professor Slughorn only invites the 'right' people to his parties." "He'll do anything for a bit of influence." "He gave Cassian Black a perfect Potions grade even though everyone knows he cheated." "He's always fishing for compliments about his rare ingredients."
