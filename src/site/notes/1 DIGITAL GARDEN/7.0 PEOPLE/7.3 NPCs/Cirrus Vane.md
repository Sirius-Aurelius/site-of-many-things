## Description
>Professor Cirrus Vane is a tall, slender witch with a hawk-like gaze and a strong tanfrom countless hours spent in the open air. Her **silver-streaked dark hair** is usually pulled back in a practical braid, but stray wisps often escape, giving her a wind-swept look. She moves with an easy, almost predatory grace, her movements economical and precise. Her robes are usually **sturdy, dark green or blue**, often with reinforced patches at the elbows and knees, hinting at an active, hands-on approach to her teaching. She carries her wand tucked securely into a wrist holster rather than a pocket.

## Notes

**Appearance:** Professor Cirrus Vane is a tall, slender witch with a hawk-like gaze and a perpetual, slight tan, a testament to countless hours spent in the open air. Her **silver-streaked dark hair** is usually pulled back in a practical braid, but stray wisps often escape, giving her a wind-swept look. She moves with an easy, almost predatory grace, her movements economical and precise. Her robes are usually **sturdy, dark green or blue**, often with reinforced patches at the elbows and knees, hinting at an active, hands-on approach to her teaching. She carries her wand tucked securely into a wrist holster rather than a pocket.

**Personality:** Professor Vane is known for her **unflappable composure** and **sharp wit**. She is utterly devoted to the art of broom flying and instills in her students a deep respect for both the skill and the inherent dangers. While she can appear stern, especially during initial lessons on the **Flying Class Lawn**, she possesses a dry sense of humour and a quiet passion that shines through when discussing advanced manoeuvres or the freedom of flight. She values **discipline, quick thinking, and courage**, but prioritises **safety** above all else. She has little patience for recklessness without skill to back it up.

**Background:** Before joining the Hogwarts faculty, Professor Vane was a renowned **Chaser for a prominent Quidditch team**, celebrated for her **precision flying and strategic prowess** rather than flashy individualism. Her professional career, much like Elfrida Warsaw (the proprietor of Broomstix and a retired pro-Quidditch player), was cut short by a non-magical injury, but her love for flying never diminished. She now dedicates herself to nurturing the next generation of aerial talents. Given the "rumours and rumblings of discord amongst our Muggle counterparts" and the official start of World War II in September 1939, she subtly hopes to develop students' aerial competence for more than just games, perhaps anticipating a need for skilled fliers in a brewing conflict.

**Teaching Style:** Professor Vane's lessons on the **Flying Class Lawn** are rigorous, beginning with the absolute basics of handling a broomstick (like calling it to hand and finding balance), before progressing to controlled ascents, descents, and turns. She uses a mix of verbal instruction, clear demonstrations, and individual feedback. She expects students to pay close attention and practice diligently. She might use charms like **_Arresto Momentum_** (The Stopping Charm) to safely slow a student's uncontrolled descent or **_Molliare_** (The Cushioning Charm) to soften landings when needed. She believes that a strong foundation is crucial, often stating, "A magnificent leap begins with a steady foot."

# Canon
- Flying lessons were off for all years until after the October half term because Professor Vane 'had to extend her summer break for personal reasons'
