**Appearance:** Still relatively young (in his late 50s-early 60s), with a vibrant twinkle in his eyes, impeccably neat attire, and a quiet air of profound power. His beard is reddish-brown, not yet flowing down to his belt. He moves with a calm confidence.
    
- **Personality:** Brilliant, enigmatic, and deeply perceptive. Dumbledore is already a legendary figure, known for his intellect and his defeat of Grindelwald's allies (though the final confrontation is yet to come). He is deceptively gentle but possesses a formidable will. He watches his students closely, particularly those he senses have great potential â€“ or great darkness. He champions unconventional thought and independent inquiry.
    
- **Gossip:** "Professor Dumbledore knows _everything_." "He never gives a straight answer, always speaks in riddles." "He's unusually interested in Tom Riddle for some reason." "Some say he's the only one who can truly stand up to Grindelwald."
