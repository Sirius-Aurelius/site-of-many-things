# Description
>_Professor Garlick has a warm, gentle face, with those little lines around her eyes that crinkle when she smiles. Her hair is a mix of gray and dark colors, currently (and possibly always) just a little bit messy, like she's been out in the greenhouses all morning. A sense that is reinforced by the dozens of tiny freckles, especially on her cheeks, that convey a life of sun, rain and soil. 
>She wears a soft gray-blue tunic with a subtle pattern on it, a bit worn in the way that clothes are when someone truly loves what they do. You can tell just by looking at her that she's kind, and you know by reputation that she knows all the secrets of every plant in the castle._
