# Description

Lily is a cheerful, artistic girl who expresses herself through her whimsical drawings. She's bright-eyed with a perpetually smudged quill in her hand and a sketchbook never far from reach. She sees the world in vibrant colors and fantastical shapes, often doodling in the margins of her textbooks. She's incredibly empathetic and picks up on others' emotions easily, often expressing what she sees through her charming, if sometimes abstract, drawings. She's a pureblood from a family of eccentrics who encourage her artistic pursuits.
