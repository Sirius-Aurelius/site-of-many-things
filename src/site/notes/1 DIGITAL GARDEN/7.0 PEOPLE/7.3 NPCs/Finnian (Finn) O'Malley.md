- **Appearance:** Tall and lanky, often seen with a slightly bewildered expression and an unkempt shock of red hair. He's got a perpetually optimistic grin.
    
- **Personality:** Easygoing, friendly, and surprisingly insightful, though he often plays dumb. Finnian is loyal to his friends to a fault and has a knack for finding lost things (and getting lost himself). He's not the brightest academically, but he has excellent common sense and a surprising amount of street smarts gleaned from holidays spent with his eccentric wizarding family. He's also surprisingly good at finding shortcuts and hidden passages.
    
- **Gossip:** "Finn's always got some wild story about his holidays, half of them can't be true." "He got detention last week for trying to teach a gnat to play the trombone." "He knows every secret passage in Hogwarts, even the ones Filch doesn't know about."
