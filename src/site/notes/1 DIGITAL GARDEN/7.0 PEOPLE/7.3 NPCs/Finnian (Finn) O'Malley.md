# Description

Finnian is a soft-spoken but incredibly resourceful boy from a large, impoverished wizarding family. He's a lanky, unassuming boy with a perpetually slightly hungry look in his eyes, but a quiet dignity. He comes from a large family with many siblings, where resourcefulness and making do were essential. He's surprisingly handy with odd jobs and can often be found fixing small things or creatively solving practical problems. He values loyalty and a good meal above all else.
