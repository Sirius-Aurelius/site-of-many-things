**Appearance:** A no-nonsense, brisk woman with a kind but firm expression. Her uniform is always immaculate, and she moves with quiet authority. She has an uncanny ability to know what's wrong with a student before they even tell her.
    
- **Personality:** Practical, compassionate, and highly efficient. Madam Willow is fiercely protective of her patients and has no patience for dramatics or self-pity. She's seen every kind of magical ailment and injury imaginable. She has a dry sense of humor and a surprising amount of common sense. She often knows more about what's going on in the school than anyone else, as students inevitably come to her with their injuries and their woes.
    
- **Gossip:** "Madam Willow can fix a broken bone with a wave of her wand, but she'll make you drink something vile first." "She knows all the secret passages for getting injured students to the Hospital Wing quickly." "She once gave Professor Kettleburn a lecture that made even _him_ speechless."
