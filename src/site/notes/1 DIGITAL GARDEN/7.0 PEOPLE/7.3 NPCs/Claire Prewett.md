# Description

Claire is small for her age but makes up for it with a fiery spirit and an unwavering sense of justice. She's quick to defend anyone being bullied or treated unfairly, often leaping into action without much thought for the consequences. Her family has a strong tradition of Ministry work, though Claire is more interested in direct action than bureaucracy. She has a sharp tongue when provoked but a deep well of compassion for those she cares about.
