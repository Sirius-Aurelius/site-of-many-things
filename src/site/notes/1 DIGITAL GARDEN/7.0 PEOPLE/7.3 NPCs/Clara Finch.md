- **Appearance:** Energetic and somewhat untidy, with a bright, curious expression. Her Gryffindor tie is often askew.
    
- **Personality:** Extremely outgoing and gregarious, Clara is a whirlwind of enthusiasm. She's genuinely kind but can be a bit tactless and prone to accidental magical mishaps when excited. She loves a good story, especially involving adventure or mystery. She's a good listener and surprisingly empathetic.
    
- **Gossip:** "Clara tried to transfigure a tea set into a badger, but ended up with a teapot that squeaked." "She knows _everyone_ on the Gryffindor side, and half the Ravenclaws too." "She's always bringing stray magical creatures back to the common room."
