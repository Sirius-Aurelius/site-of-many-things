# Description

> Kiko is a **goblin**, a magical being with the characteristic swarthy skin, long, clever fingers, and sharp, intelligent features of his kind. However, he immediately stands apart from the severe, often sneering goblins one might encounter in places like Gringotts. For his species, Kiko is **unusually sociable and agreeable**.

>His typical attire is practical rather than ceremonial, befitting his role as a **Foreman and Chief Engineer**. He often wears a sturdy tunic and well-made boots, clothes that suggest a hands-on approach to his work. A pair of intricate brass goggles are frequently pushed up onto his high forehead, ready for detailed work at a moment's notice.

>What truly distinguishes Kiko is his demeanour. His dark eyes are bright with an uncommon **inquisitiveness**. When observing someone, his expression is one of genuine curiosity and assessment, not hostility. He lacks the pinched, severe expression common to many goblins, and a brief, genuine smile is not an uncommon sight. His voice is clear and precise, carrying an air of authority that is neither harsh nor demanding.

>This combination of traits makes him a complex and noteworthy figure. He is not merely an engineer but is also **politically shrewd**. In his open posture and direct gaze, one can sense a diplomat's cunning wrapped in a craftsman's practical guise. His agreeable manner is a key element in the breakthrough wizard-goblin relations his work represents. He is a goblin of the earth, not the vault, and a pioneer confidently navigating a new era of cooperation.

- **Identity:** Kiko is a goblin Chief Engineer, employed as Foreman at [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.4 Hogwarts Valley/8.4.2 Hogwarts Valley Mine\|Hogwarts Valley Mine]] by the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.2 Factions/07.2.17 The Hogwarts Valley Mining Co.\|HVMC]]. He is a part of the unprecedented goblin mining operation taking place in Hogwarts Valley.
    
- **Expertise:** His skills lie in magical engineering and mining techniques.
        
- **Significance of his work:** The mining operation itself is a new and significant event in goblin-wizard relations, making Kiko and his work a point of contention between different factions within the wizarding world.
