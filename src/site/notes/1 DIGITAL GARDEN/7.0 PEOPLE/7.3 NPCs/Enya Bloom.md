- **Appearance:** Dreamy and ethereal, often wearing slightly mismatched or unusually decorated robes. She has wide, curious eyes and an otherworldly air.

She's incredibly perceptive, often noticing things others miss, though her conclusions can be wildly unconventional.

- **Gossip:** "Enya believes in all sorts of weird creatures, like 'Wrackspurts' and 'Nargles'." "She once tried to convince Professor Flitwick that the Charms classroom was infested with 'Glimmerglobs'." "She knows an alarming amount about forbidden creatures."
