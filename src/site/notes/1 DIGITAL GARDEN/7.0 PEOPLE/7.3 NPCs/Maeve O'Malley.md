# Description

Maeve is a sensitive and artistic soul among the O'Malleys, often found sketching in a worn notebook. She has a keen eye for detail and a thoughtful, often pensive, demeanor. While outwardly compliant, she harbors a quiet rebellious streak, questioning norms and seeking beauty in unexpected places. She's drawn to Ancient Runes and Arithmancy, finding solace and patterns in complex systems. She has a particularly soft spot for Finnian and worries about him.
