# Description

From player back story:
> Star Seeker for The Bow Hammers Quidditch team

>_Cassie's heart swelled with pride watching their star Seeker, a daring wizard named Silas "The Streak" Thorne, whose dives were so reckless they frequently left opposing teams tangled in knots (although she never saw the end of the dive, the stands obscured an awful lot!)_
