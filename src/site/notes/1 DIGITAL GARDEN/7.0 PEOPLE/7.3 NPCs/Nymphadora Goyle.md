# Description

Nymphadora is a quiet, watchful girl who often appears to be in the shadow of more boisterous Slytherins. She comes from a family known for their loyalty to prominent pureblood lines, and she carries that fierce, almost unquestioning, loyalty herself. She's not quick to speak but absorbs everything around her, making her surprisingly well-informed. She's protective of those she considers "hers" and can be quite formidable when roused. She has a particular affinity for Defense Against the Dark Arts, showing a raw talent for defensive spells.
