# Description

* **Appearance:** A sturdy, good-natured boy with a perpetually messy mop of brown hair and a scattering of freckles. He has a warm, inviting smile and often looks slightly rumpled, as if he's just tumbled out of bed or a particularly vigorous game of Exploding Snap.

* **Personality:** Liam is the epitome of Hufflepuff loyalty and good cheer. He's incredibly earnest and always tries his best, even if he sometimes falls short academically. What he lacks in raw magical talent, he makes up for in sheer determination and an uncanny knack for finding practical solutions. He's a friend to everyone and often acts as a mediator in disputes.

* **Gossip:** "Liam apparently knows all the house-elves by name â€“ he gets extra treacle tart!" "He once fixed a broken Vanishing Cabinet with a hairpin and some chewing gum, or so the rumor goes." "If you need a favor, Liam's the one to ask; he'll always try to help, no matter what."
