# Description

Barnaby is an excitable, perpetually optimistic boy with a love for magical creatures. He's a sturdy, cheerful boy with a wide grin and hair that always seems to be sticking out in odd directions. He's easily excited by new discoveries, especially anything to do with magical creatures, and has an endless supply of fascinating (and sometimes slightly embellished) stories about the animals back home. His family runs a small, ethical Kneazle breeding operation.
