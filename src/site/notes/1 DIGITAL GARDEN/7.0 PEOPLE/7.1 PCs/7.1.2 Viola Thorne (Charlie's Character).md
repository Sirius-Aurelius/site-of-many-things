# Viola Thorne Backstory

Name: Viola “Vi” Thorne

House: Hufflepuff

Blood Status: Half-blood

Background: Potioneer

School of Magic: Healing

Feat: Steady Caster

Wand: Larch, Dragon Heartstring, 10.5", Quite Flexible

Hometown: Wiltshire (West Country)

  

Viola Thorne was born in 1926 in a sleepy Wiltshire village where cobbled streets wind between old stone cottages and wild herbs grow freely at the edges of the woods. Her family home sits just behind Thorne’s Remedies, a small apothecary run by her parents—her mother tending to magical ailments, her father serving the local Muggle community with herbal treatments and trustworthy advice.

Her mother, Morwenna Thorne (known as Moira to avoid suspicion in the muggle community), is a gifted magical healer who served during the Great War in a covert field unit near the Western Front. Her father, Thomas Thorne, a Muggle soldier, would have died from infected wounds were it not for Morwenna’s quiet magic and unshakable calm. She saved his life. They married not long after the war ended—her steadfastness matched by his warmth and unwavering loyalty.

Thorne’s Remedies became known both in the magical world and among Muggles as a place of skill and kindness. Morwenna brewed in the back, Thomas chatted in the front, and between them they raised their only child in a home that always smelled faintly of mint, pepper-up potion, and old books.

Viola spent her childhood among drying herbs and bubbling cauldrons, learning the names of plants before she could spell her own. But for most of those years, her magic remained dormant. While other magical children sparked accidental levitations or changed hair color in tantrums, Viola had nothing. Her parents never doubted her, but Viola worried in silence. She worked harder, read more, practiced—but no spells came.

That changed the day she was chosen by a wand of larch wood and dragon heartstring—a pairing known for bringing out hidden potential. From the first moment it settled in her hand, something shifted. Charms began to stick. Potions brewed true. 

Viola is precise, self-driven, and deeply respectful of those who’ve mastered their craft. She keeps a tin of chocolate frog cards, collecting and studying the stories of great witches and wizards—not for fame, but for insight. She doesn’t just want to be good. She wants to be exceptional.

Now at Hogwarts, sorted into Hufflepuff for her quiet loyalty and tireless work ethic, Viola arrives with ink-stained fingers, a stitched-up satchel, and a Muggle notebook filled with annotated potion notes. She rarely boasts, but she never forgets a mistake—or a lesson. She is not loud, but she is unshakable.

# Viola’s Wand

Wood: Larch  
Core: Dragon Heartstring  
Length: 10.5 inches  
Flexibility: Quite Flexible

This wand is elegant in its simplicity—crafted from pale, golden-toned larch wood, known for bringing out hidden talents and quiet courage in its wielder. Its grain is smooth and tight, with a subtle natural twist near the base, as if to hint at untapped potential. In Viola’s hand, it hums with a sense of readiness, as though waiting for her to grow into everything it knows she can become.

Its dragon heartstring core reflects her ambition and inner fire—an intense drive to master her craft and be recognised for her skill. The wand is responsive and precise, well-suited to delicate healing work and complex potion-making, where control is everything.

Though Viola showed little outward magic before this wand chose her, it immediately responded to her discipline and focus—awakening abilities that had been quietly waiting to surface. The wand doesn’t amplify her—it reveals her.

# Plop the Toad

  

Species: Harlequin Toad (Magical Variant)  
Size: Palm-sized | Eyes: Bronze with green flecks  
Skin: Velvety black with golden-mossy markings that shimmer faintly  
Temperament: Watchful, unbothered, slightly smug  
Favourite Spot: Curled in a moss-lined pouch in Viola’s satchel

---

Viola met Plop when she was eight.

She was foraging near the stream behind Thorne’s Remedies. Viola, already dabbling in harmless herb-based brews, was gathering plants for a calming tonic she’d read about in an old alchemical book.

She spotted him on a mossy rock near the bank: small, velvety black, with strange golden-green markings that seemed to shimmer in the light. He didn’t hop away when she approached. Instead, he stared up at her, still and unblinking, as if waiting.

She held out an empty ingredient jar. He jumped in.  
Plop.

From that day on, he stayed.

Viola didn’t think of Plop as magical at first. He was just a toad who didn’t seem to mind when she talked to herself while measuring roots or experimenting with temperature. But over time, she began to notice things: how he croaked when she leaned too close to the flame, or how his skin faintly changed colour in reaction to certain potion fumes.

She recorded it all in her notebook—not as superstition, but as data. Observations. Patterns.  
Still, she never relied on him.

**Plop isn’t the reason her potions work—**her precision, intuition, and long hours of study are.  
But he’s a comfort. A quiet, steady rhythm at the edge of her workspace.  
If he’s there, she might talk aloud more. Think more clearly. Slow down.

---

Plop isn’t cuddly. He isn’t flashy.  
He’s observant, calm, and just clever enough to make Viola occasionally wonder if he understands more than he lets on.

He lives in a moss-lined pouch in her satchel and peers out at the world like he’s taking notes of his own.  
Sometimes he croaks when someone enters the room unexpectedly.  
Sometimes he jumps up to the rim of her cauldron just as she’s about to try something bold.

Personality Traits

- Potion Watcher: Plop loves perching near bubbling cauldrons and seems particularly attuned to potion fumes. Viola suspects he can sense when something’s “off.”  
      
    
- Emotionally Unavailable (but loyal): He’s not cuddly—but he will quietly hop into her lap when she’s having a hard day.  
      
    
- Alarm System: Plop croaks when someone enters the room behind her, or if something unusual stirs the air. Viola pretends not to rely on this, but she absolutely does.  
      
    
- Critically Observant: Has a habit of staring intensely at people mid-conversation, as though judging their life choices.

### Magical Quirks

- Skin shimmers faintly in reaction to active magic—especially brewing potions.  
      
    
- Occasionally changes hue based on magical exposure (green tinge = calming potion; purple tinge = sleep draught fumes).  
      
    
- Can absorb harmless magical energies through his skin—handy for testing potion traces.
