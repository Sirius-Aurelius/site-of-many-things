See [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/1.0-2.0 RULES/1.0 Variant Rules/01.06.1.6 Background - Potioneer#**d6 Length (Bond)**\|01.06.1.6 Background - Potioneer#**d6 Length (Bond)**]]

> *Larch wands have a reputation for instilling confidence and courage in the user. The celebrated wandmaker Garrick Ollivander found that larch always created wands of hidden talents and unexpected effects, which likewise describes the master who deserves it. It is often the case that the witch or wizard who belongs to the larch wand may never realize the full extent of their considerable talents until paired with it, but that they will then make an exceptional match.*

### Wand core (Ideals): Dragon Heartstring

> *Quite Flexible: I'm horribly jealous of anyone who outshines my work. Everywhere I go, I'm surrounded by rivals.*

## Viola's D.I.A.D.E.M. Abilities

Vi is unsure - perhaps even insecure - about why she has been selected for the DIADEM program. Is this a mistake, or do they know or see something that she doesn't?
