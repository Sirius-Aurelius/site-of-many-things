The Weasleys of Tent Tenement

Cassia "Cassie" Weasley, an 11-year-old whirlwind of fiery red hair and mischief, was a pint-sized force of nature growing up in the bustling, less-than-glamorous streets of Mile End in London. While her older brother, Septimus, was off at Hogwarts, likely with his nose in a book or tinkering with some Muggle contraption from Muggle born mates, Cassie was surviving on the city's unforgiving pavement.

Their family home was less of a house and more of a magical marvel: a Weasley tent, cleverly disguised to look like a rundown tenement building. It stood on a forgotten corner in Mile End, a patch of land initially slated for a Tube station that never materialised. Inside, the tent expanded into a cozy, if chaotic, warren of rooms, always smelling faintly of burnt toast and old parchment. It was here that Cassie lived with her Gran Nell, her parents Perseus and Lavender Weasley, Septimus, and her younger siblings: Fabian, Gideon, Bilius, Fern, and little Arthur.
Life wasn't easy for the Weasleys, even with their ancient magical lineage. 

Perseus, a kind but perpetually stressed man, worked as a Magical Artefact Repairman, often bringing home strange, sputtering contraptions that filled their small living area. His meagre earnings barely covered the family's needs. Lavender, Cassie's mother, a witch with a warm heart and a knack for making ends meet, ran a small, illicit business from inside their tent: she was a Muggle-Wizard Liaison and Fixer. She helped newly-arrived Muggleborns navigate the wizarding world and often acted as an intermediary for wizards needing discreet assistance in the Muggle realm, earning barely enough to keep their large family fed.

The tent itself, despite its magical properties, was a constant source of woe. It seemed to have a personality all its own, prone to developing leaks and tears that no amount of charm or spell could permanently fix. The Weasleys were in a perpetual state of patching and repairing, using everything from spellotape to hastily conjured mending spells. A sudden downpour could turn the living room into a shallow pond, and a particularly strong gust of wind might rip a new hole in the fabric, requiring an immediate, frantic scramble from the whole family to prevent their belongings from being soaked or blown away. These constant repairs, often done with humour but always with a weary sigh, were a daily reminder of their precarious, hand-to-mouth existence.

A Seer's Secret and Gran's Wisdom
Despite her knack for skirting responsibilities and her general aversion to anything resembling hard work – she'd say or do anything to get out of chores – Cassie possessed an unwavering loyalty to those she loves. Her family was her world, and she'd move heaven and earth, or at least a few ill-gotten goods, to keep them safe and happy.
Of all her family, Cassie shared a special, unspoken bond with her grandmother, Nell Weasley. Gran Nell, with her wise, crinkled eyes and a scent of dried herbs and fire whiskey about her, was Cassie's confidante and quiet mentor. It was Nell who had knitted the colourful "wandom" that concealed Cassie's powerful elder wood wand – a practical gift to keep attention away from Cassie. Nell had always been the first to understand Cassie's peculiar "feelings" about future events, never dismissing them as childish imagination.

That's because Gran Nell possessed a quiet, understated gift of her own: the "seeing eye." Not prone to dramatic prophecies or tea-leaf readings, Nell's divination manifested as a subtle, intuitive sense of what was to come, a wisdom that often guided her family through their many trials. She'd "just know" when a certain problem could resolve itself, or when Perseus should "just not bother with that gadget, dear."

It was from Nell that Cassie inherited her own uncanny ability to foresee small, mundane events. Her divination wasn't about grand visions but sharp, practical insights. She'd "know" when the butcher's shop down the street had a fresh delivery of bacon, catching the faint, distinct scent on the morning wind even before it was visible, ensuring she could "acquire" some for the family breakfast. Or she'd dream of a strong wind from the East, causing her to wake with an urgent, undeniable feeling that the tent needed propping up on that side to prevent a new tear. As she grew, these premonitions became clearer, often manifesting as vivid, fleeting images or sudden, undeniable feelings that guided her many escapades and helped her to provide for her family. Gran Nell was the only one Cassie truly trusted with the full extent of her premonitions, often sharing hushed whispers in the dim corners of their tent-home. Her grandmother's knowing nods and gentle guidance taught Cassie how to lean into her gift, even when others might not understand it.

Street Smarts and Practical Magic

Cassie's innate abilities, coupled with the family's constant struggle, meant she learned early to rely on her wits. More than once, her peculiar foresight proved invaluable.

One biting winter morning, with the Weasley children's stomachs rumbling, Cassie was in the cold and inherited bath water when she felt a strange and disconcerting feeling of fish, swimming at her feet. Weird. But trusting her previous premonition of smelling bacon on the wind (the butcher has a fresh delivery of gammon), Cassie felt an insistent tug towards the fishmonger's stall a few streets away. It wasn't the usual street sounds she heard, but a faint, almost melodic hum in her mind. When they arrived, the fishmonger, a gruff man named Mr. Grubb, was fuming, having just dropped an entire basket of perfectly good cod into a muddy puddle. As he swore and began to kick the ruined fish aside, Cassie, with a well-practiced, angelic gaze and a voice just sweet enough to melt frost, approached him.

"Oh, Mr. Grubb," she began, her voice brimming with earnest sympathy, "what a truly dreadful shame! All that beautiful cod, wasted. It just breaks my heart to see such fine fish meet such an unfortunate end."

Mr. Grubb, caught off guard by the sincere, sorrowful tone from the small, red-headed girl, paused his kicking. "Aye, well, it's done for now, ain't it? Muddy, it is. Can't sell muddy fish, not in this establishment."

Cassie's eyes widened, her innocent gaze fixed on the discarded fish. "But it's such a terrible waste! If only someone could take these poor fish off your hands, Mr. Grubb, you'd be rid of the mess instantly. And perhaps... perhaps they could still be put to good use, for folks who aren't quite so particular?" She offered him a hopeful, almost pleading smile, a tiny hand reaching out as if to comfort a wounded bird.

Charmed by her earnest sympathy and perhaps utterly bewildered by her appearance just as he was most frustrated, Mr. Grubb, to his own later bewilderment, grumbled, "Well, I suppose it's better than leaving 'em to rot in the gutter, eh? Fine, girl, take 'em. Get 'em out of my sight. Don't want no bad luck lingering." He waved a dismissive hand, practically giving her the mud-splattered cod for free, just to get rid of the "unlucky" lot. A quick cleaning charm from Gran Nell later, and the Weasleys had fish stew for days.

Cassie's persuasive powers were legendary among her siblings, but she once faced her toughest challenge when her Pa was unjustly accused of pilfering some magical components from a closed shop. A gruff Muggle policeman, PC Jenkins, had a meticulously filled notebook that held all the flimsy "evidence." Knowing her Pa was innocent, but also knowing the family couldn't afford a proper wizarding defence, Cassie took matters into her own hands. She observed PC Jenkins's patrol route for days, intuiting when he'd be most distracted. One rainy afternoon, as he was grumbling about a lost umbrella near a particularly lively street performer, Cassie, with a dazzling, distracting smile, "accidentally" tripped, sending a scattering of brightly polished brass buttons from her pocket rolling across the wet pavement. As PC Jenkins, ever the dutiful officer, bent to help her gather them, Cassie, with a nimble-fingered subtlety that would make a Gringotts goblin proud, slipped his notebook from his jacket pocket. By the time the supposed court date arrived, PC Jenkins couldn't find his crucial notes, and without them, the charges against Perseus mysteriously vanished.

Chocolate Frog Card Collection

Cassie had few luxuries. She never had money to buy Chocolate Frogs, so she resorted to scavenging. She always found discarded cards from others, left behind by those frustrated by getting yet another duplicate. Her collection consisted of bent, dog-eared edges, some water-marked or stained with grease from chip shop paper. Her prized finds included:

Albus Dumbledore: Even in 1939, Dumbledore was a prominent figure, especially after his duel with Grindelwald in 1945 (which would be in the near future for Cassie).

Morgana: A classic, ancient wizard, always a staple in Chocolate Frogs.

Paracelsus: A renowned alchemist and physician from the Muggle world, often featured for his contributions to medicine and magic.
 
Merlin: Another ancient, universally recognized wizard.

Wendelin the Weird: Known for her love of being burned at the stake, an eccentric character that would likely be printed often.

Ignatia Wildsmith: Inventor of Floo powder, a practical and widely used magical item, making her a common card.
 
Queen Maeve: A powerful Irish witch from legend.

Quidditch Fandom

The Bow Hammers
Despite the family's financial struggles, Cassie found joy and escape in the local Quidditch scene. Her favourite team was The Bow Hammers, their maroon and baby blue a familiar splash against the London skyline. She had never paid for a ticket. Instead, her chosen perch was the precarious, often draughty, roof of their disguised tenement, offering a surprisingly good, if windswept, view of distant matches from the nearby pitch, or at least the roars and distant flashes of magic. Her heart swelled with pride watching their star Seeker, a daring wizard named Silas "The Streak" Thorne, whose dives were so reckless they frequently left opposing teams tangled in knots (although she never saw the end of the dive, the stands obscured an awful lot!). She also adored their feisty Beater, Brenda "The Bruiser" Buttercup, a no-nonsense witch who seemed to relish sending Bludgers flying with a ferocity that made even the toughest Chasers wince. Cassie admired their audacious spirit and rule-bending flair, seeing a reflection of her own independent nature in their fearless play.

A Most Unexpected Visit, a Chilling Warning, and a Curious Gift

Her most prized possession, and her biggest secret, was her wand. Made of rare elder wood, it hummed with a quiet power that felt almost too grand for an eleven-year-old. When she first went to Ollivanders, the shop had practically glowed as the wand flew into her hand. Ollivander himself, pale and shaken, had immediately recognised the rare wood and its implications. He was required to notify Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic of such a significant, almost fated, wand choice. This revelation made Cassie an anomaly, marking her as someone touched by unusual magic. Cassie, however, found the attention unsettling and always hid her wand with her Gran Nell's knitted "wandom", a practical way to ensure her powerful secret stayed just that: a secret.

This formal notification to the Ministry, in August 1939, brought an immediate and somewhat unwelcome response. Just days after Cassie's visit to Ollivanders, two stern-faced Ministry officials arrived at the tentament in Mile End, their robes looking comically out of place against the backdrop of gritty East London. Their interest was clear: a gifted young witch, chosen by an exceptionally rare wand, and exhibiting an innate talent for Divination. With Grindelwald's influence growing across Europe and the shadows of a Muggle war looming, the Ministry was intensely focused on preventing any particularly powerful British students from being lured to darker institutions like Durmstrang Institute, known for its more dubious magical leanings and less-than-stringent policies on Dark Arts.
Cassie squirmed under their scrutiny, and as she struggled, a different, more chilling set of visions had begun to plague her. These weren't small, practical premonitions; these were flashes of roaring flames, distant sirens, crumbling buildings, and the pervasive scent of ash and fear that clung to the air in her dreams. Driven by an urgent, uncharacteristic solemnity, Cassie spoke up during the Ministry's interrogation, interrupting her mother's shrewd negotiations. "There's a war coming," she'd stated, her small voice cutting through the stuffy atmosphere, "bigger than anything. Flames everywhere. Right here in London. And it's very, very soon."

Her words, delivered with undeniable conviction, sent a shiver through the officials. Though they maintained their professional composure, the subtle shift in their demeanor was not lost on Lavender. Cassie's warning, coupled with her raw, untrained power, solidified the Ministry's desperate need to keep her within their fold.
Lavender Weasley, ever the pragmatist and fixer, saw not just a threat, but an even greater opportunity. She engaged the Ministry officials in a surprisingly shrewd negotiation. 

"Our children deserve a proper, stable home," she'd stated, her voice calm but firm, gesturing pointedly at a particularly persistent leak dripping into a bucket. "A tent, no matter how charmed, is hardly a suitable environment for a family with such a... unique daughter, especially with what's coming."

As part of their ongoing "discussions" and perhaps as a subtle attempt to curry favour and ensure Cassie's loyalty, the Ministry officials presented her with an unexpected gift: a tiny, baby Niffler. It was no bigger than her hand, with soft black fur and an impossibly long snout, already sniffing eagerly at the buckles on the officials' briefcases. Cassie, utterly enchanted, immediately named him "Bernard," a rather dignified name for such a mischievous little creature. The Niffler, notorious for its love of all things glittery, became Cassie's constant, if sometimes troublesome, companion, a living, breathing symbol of the Ministry's unusual interest in her.

Lavender made it clear that if the Ministry was so concerned about her daughter's future and allegiance, and now about her visions of impending conflict, they could demonstrate their commitment. Her demand was audacious but calculated: land in Devon, near Ottery St Catchpole, a rural area known for its strong magical community and discreet, established wizarding families. It was a bold play, but the Ministry, eager to secure Cassie's enrollment at Hogwarts and ensure her talents remained loyal to British magic – and perhaps to gain an unexpected source of intelligence – found themselves in a difficult position. The negotiation was ongoing, but the offer was on the table, a potentially life-changing deal for the Weasleys. Land only though. The Ministry would not build the home. When Cassie was settled, they would start the great build and migration. Maybe in October…?
