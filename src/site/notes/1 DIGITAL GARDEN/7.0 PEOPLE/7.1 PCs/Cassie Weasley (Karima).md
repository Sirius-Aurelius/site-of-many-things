Background:: Troublemaker
Length: 13.5 inches  
Wood: Elder
Core: Phoenix feather  
Flexibility: Flexible

###### From player back story
>_Her most prized possession, and her biggest secret, was her wand. Made of rare elder wood, it hummed with a quiet power that felt almost too grand for an eleven-year-old. When she first went to Ollivanders, the shop had practically glowed as the wand flew into her hand. Ollivander himself, pale and shaken, had immediately recognised the rare wood and its implications._

> *The rarest wand wood of all, and reputed to be unlucky (a baseless superstition), elder wands are trickiest to master. They contain powerful magic, but scorn any owner who is not a superior caster; it takes a remarkable wizard to keep an elder wand. The truth is that only a highly unusual person will find their perfect match in elder, but that witch or wizard in question is certainly marked out for a special destiny.*

# Cassie's Openly-Shared Back Story

>Her most prized possession, and her biggest secret, was her wand. Made of rare elder wood, it hummed with a quiet power that felt almost too grand for an eleven-year-old. When she first went to Ollivanders, the shop had practically glowed as the wand flew into her hand. Ollivander himself, pale and shaken, had immediately recognised the rare wood and its implications. He was required to notify Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic of such a significant, almost fated, wand choice. This revelation made Cassie an anomaly, marking her as someone touched by unusual magic. Cassie, however, found the attention unsettling and always hid her wand with her Gran Nell's knitted "wandom", a practical way to ensure her powerful secret stayed just that: a secret.

>This formal notification to the Ministry, in August 1939, brought an immediate and somewhat unwelcome response. Just days after Cassie's visit to Ollivanders, two stern-faced Ministry officials arrived at the tentament in Mile End, their robes looking comically out of place against the backdrop of gritty East London. Their interest was clear: a gifted young witch, chosen by an exceptionally rare wand, and exhibiting an innate talent for Divination. With Grindelwald's influence growing across Europe and the shadows of a Muggle war looming, the Ministry was intensely focused on preventing any particularly powerful British students from being lured to darker institutions like Durmstrang Institute, known for its more dubious magical leanings and less-than-stringent policies on Dark Arts.

>As part of their ongoing "discussions" and perhaps as a subtle attempt to curry favour and ensure Cassie's loyalty, the Ministry officials presented her with an unexpected gift: a tiny, baby Niffler. It was no bigger than her hand, with soft black fur and an impossibly long snout, already sniffing eagerly at the buckles on the officials' briefcases. Cassie, utterly enchanted, immediately named him "Bernard," a rather dignified name for such a mischievous little creature. The Niffler, notorious for its love of all things glittery, became Cassie's constant, if sometimes troublesome, companion, a living, breathing symbol of the Ministry's unusual interest in her.
