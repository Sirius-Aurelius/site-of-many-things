###### Wand Summary
Background:: Troublemaker
Length: 13.5 inches  
Wood: Elder
Core: Phoenix feather  
Flexibility: Flexible

###### From player back story
>_Her most prized possession, and her biggest secret, was her wand. Made of rare elder wood, it hummed with a quiet power that felt almost too grand for an eleven-year-old. When she first went to Ollivanders, the shop had practically glowed as the wand flew into her hand. Ollivander himself, pale and shaken, had immediately recognised the rare wood and its implications._

### Wand length (Bonds): 13.5"

> *13.5": No one else is going to have to endure the hardships I've been through.*

### Wand wood (Traits): Elder (*very rare*)

> *The rarest wand wood of all, and reputed to be unlucky (a baseless superstition), elder wands are trickiest to master. They contain powerful magic, but scorn any owner who is not a superior caster; it takes a remarkable wizard to keep an elder wand. The truth is that only a highly unusual person will find their perfect match in elder, but that witch or wizard in question is certainly marked out for a special destiny.*

### Wand core (Ideals): Phoenix Feather

> *Phoenix Feather: Freedom. When people follow rules blindly, they imprison themselves.*

# Cassie's D.I.A.D.E.M Abilities

From player back story:
> _It was from Nell that Cassie inherited her own uncanny ability to foresee small, mundane events._ 
> _Her divination wasn't about grand visions but sharp, practical insights. She'd "know" when the butcher's shop down the street had a fresh delivery of bacon, catching the faint, distinct scent on the morning wind even before it was visible, ensuring she could "acquire" some for the family breakfast. Or she'd dream of a strong wind from the East, causing her to wake with an urgent, undeniable feeling that the tent needed propping up on that side to prevent a new tear._ 
> _As she grew, these premonitions became clearer, often manifesting as vivid, fleeting images or sudden, undeniable feelings that guided her many escapades and helped her to provide for her family. Gran Nell was the only one Cassie truly trusted with the full extent of her premonitions, often sharing hushed whispers in the dim corners of their tent-home. Her grandmother's knowing nods and gentle guidance taught Cassie how to lean into her gift, even when others might not understand it._

>_Cassie squirmed under_ (the scrutiny of two visiting Ministry officials), _and as she struggled, a different, more chilling set of visions had begun to plague her. These weren't small, practical premonitions; these were flashes of roaring flames, distant sirens, crumbling buildings, and the pervasive scent of ash and fear that clung to the air in her dreams. Driven by an urgent, uncharacteristic solemnity, Cassie spoke up during the Ministry's interrogation, interrupting her mother's shrewd negotiations. "There's a war coming," she'd stated, her small voice cutting through the stuffy atmosphere, "bigger than anything. Flames everywhere. Right here in London. And it's very, very soon."_
>_Her words, delivered with undeniable conviction, sent a shiver through the officials._
