> *Wand-quality redwood is in short supply due to its reputation for bringing good fortune. As usual with wandlore, the populace has it backwards: redwood wands are not themselves lucky, but are strongly attracted to witches and wizards who already possess the admirable ability to fall on their feet, to make the right choice, to snatch advantage from catastrophe. One can expect to hear of exciting exploits when such a witch or wizard wields a redwood wand.*

### Wand core (Ideals): Dragon Heartstring
