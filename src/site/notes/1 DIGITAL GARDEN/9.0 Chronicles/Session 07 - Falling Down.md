## *Session Summary*

### Half-Term Activities and Ministry Scrutiny

Our three protaganists were temporarily separated during the break: Cassie Weasley and Basil Featherstone stayed at Hogwarts, while Viola Thorne returned to Thorne's Remedies to spend time with her parents.

- **Basil's Situation:** Basil remained at Hogwarts, having received dispatches from his father, Major Rudolph Augustus Featherstone, suggesting Hogwarts was safer than Mallory Court, and informing Basil that he was returning to the war office to fulfill his duty.

- **Viola's Actions:** While at her family's apothecary, Vi encountered **Percival Graves, Dept of Secrets**, who visited Thorne's Remedies asking questions apparently designed to implicate Professor Jackdaw Finch. Vi managed to secretly listen to the conversation despite her protective mother, Morwenna Thorne (Moira), attempting to conceal her presence using a powerful _Fidelius Charm_. Vi overheard her mother use the cryptic phrase, "**Seeing that which is hidden**," in connection with Vi’s unusual abilities. Vi successfully brewed an **exceptional Sleeping Draught** with her mother, utilizing the unprecedentedly aggressive flobberworm mucus the students had previously acquired. Vi decided to return the academic papers she had previously taken from Septimus Finch's old desk, acknowledging that they focused on themes of attraction, repulsion, magnetics, and proximity. Using the family owl, Puffin, Vi sent a message via the Messaging Scrap to Cassie and Basil detailing Graves's suspicious visit.

- **Hogwarts Investigation:** Cassie attempted to find information on the strange crystal found in the Cold Plant Room. Failing to find anything in the open section of the library, Cassie tried to access the Restricted Section using _Alohomora_, but was repelled by a **powerful protective charm**. Basil created a distraction by knocking over books on love potions and charms, prompting Cassie to fake Peeves the Poltergeist throwing a book at her to avoid trouble with Madame Pince. Despite the theatrical deceit, both were taken before **Headmaster Dippet**, who, finding the matter amusing, merely dismissed them with a warning. Cassie took the opportunity to question Dippet about the crystal, claiming she found it in the Forbidden Forest Test Pit; he replied they were **inert unless imbued with power** and showed no special recognition.

### The Quest for the Crypt

Basil successfully tracked down **The Fat Friar** to inquire about the fate of Eleonora Humblewood. Basil was able to share an extraordinary vision of the Friar’s own death—executed by his fellow monks after imprisonment—leading the ghost to reveal a terrifying risk: **ghosts can share memories and visions with Diviners if touched**. The Friar warned Basil that this phenomenon was what had driven Eleonora Humblewood to madness, prompting his fear for Basil's well-being.

The trio subsequently found the **Room of Requirement** with ease.

- **Testing the Room:** Cassie successfully conjured a London Cheesecake, confirming the room's identity, but further attempts to conjure specific items failed. The room instead conjured a seemingly endless staircase leading downwards, presumably toward Eleonora Humblewood’s Crypt.
- **The Descent:** During their descent, Basil fell down a section that transformed into a slide. After landing, Vi tended his wounds as Cassie investigated a concealed door.
- **The Manifestation:** Opening the door revealed a plain brick wall, through which burst a **small, aggressive blue mote of light**, similar to a wraith Basil had previously seen beneath the Cold Plant Room. The mote moved directly toward Basil. Cassie swiftly cast _Impervius_, successfully repelling the aggressive mote, which retreated back into the wall. The trio suspected this blue light was a manifestation of Eleonora Humblewood attempting to contact or harm Basil.
- **The Quake and Escape:** Giving up on reaching the bottom, Cassie attempted to shorten the staircase, succeeding, but the Room momentarily held them captive. While stuck underground and protected by the Room, the trio experienced **extreme ground tremors** (an earthquake or seismic event) shaking the entire foundations of the school. Upon being released by the Room, they emerged into the castle proper to find a **scene of extraordinary destruction**, with an entire colonnaded section of Hogwarts having crumbled, accompanied by screams of terror and pain from the occupied parts of the castle.

[[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]], tipping the nearest stack of books onto the floor seek to distract [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Irma (Madam) Pince\|Madame (Irma) Pince]]

Event:: As [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Irma (Madam) Pince\|Irma (Madam) Pince]] questions [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]]'s dubious literary choices (the stack of books he tipped over as a distraction was all about love potions and charms) [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Peeves the Poltergeist\|Peeves the Poltergeist]] rocks up to bask in [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] getting told off. In an attempt to avoid being taken to [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Armando Dippet\|Headmaster Dippet]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] fakes [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Peeves the Poltergeist\|Peeves the Poltergeist]] throwing a book at her.

Event:: Despite their best efforts [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] and [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] are brought before [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Armando Dippet\|Headmaster Dippet]] for causing a disturbance in the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.4.03.1 School Library - Open Section\|School Library (open section)]]. The headmaster, seemingly more amused than annoyed, lets them off with a warning on the promise it will not happen again and that they report themselves to [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Mirabel Garlick\|Mirabel Garlick]]. They do no such thing.

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] asks [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Armando Dippet\|Headmaster Dippet]] about the crystal she took from [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.01 Cold Plant Room\|Cold Plant Room]] (pretending she found it in the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.4 Hogwarts Valley/8.4.1.1 Forbidden Forest Test Pit\|Forbidden Forest Test Pit]]). Dippet says that they are inert unless imbued with some sort of power and he seems unrecognising and unaware of any special significance to this particular crystal. [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] does not share where she truly found it or the effect it seemed o have on them (and on [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] expecially)

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] seeks out [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/The Fat Friar\|The Fat Friar]] (with some difficulty) to finally ask about his memories of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)\|Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)]]. Basil shares an extraordinary vision of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/The Fat Friar\|The Fat Friar]]'s death, executed after a long imprisonment by his fellow monks. The Friar explains that ghosts can touch Basil and share what they saw in life. But if touched by a Diviner, there is a risk of seeing their visions. This is what caused [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)\|Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)]] to fall into madness and is why [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/The Fat Friar\|The Fat Friar]] fears for [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] 

Event:: Receiving [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]]'s letter via [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1.1 Pets/Puffin (Thorne Family Owl)\|Puffin (Thorne Family Owl)]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] use the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/6.0 Items/Messaging Scrap\|Messaging Scrap]] to inform [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Jackdaw Finch\|Jackdaw Finch]] that [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Percival Graves, Dept of Secrets\|Percival Graves, Dept of Secrets]] visited [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] at [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.5 Wider World/8.5.1 South West/8.5.1.01 Thorne’s Remedies, Castle Coombe\|Thorne's Remedies]] seeking incriminating information on him

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Jackdaw Finch\|Jackdaw Finch]] visits [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.5 Wider World/8.5.1 South West/8.5.1.01 Thorne’s Remedies, Castle Coombe\|Thorne's Remedies]] to apologise to [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Morwenna (Moira) Thorne\|Morwenna]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Thomas Thorne\|Thomas Thorne]] for his former Ministry colleague's ([[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Percival Graves, Dept of Secrets\|Percival Graves, Dept of Secrets]]) impromptu visit. Once again a protective [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Morwenna (Moira) Thorne\|Morwenna (Moira) Thorne]] attempts to hide [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]], this time using a powerful [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Fidelius Mysteria Celare\|Fidelius Charm]]. Vi overhears most of the conversation nevetheless, including one particularly striking phrase from her mother regarding some of Vi's experiences at the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.4 Hogwarts Valley/8.4.1.1 Forbidden Forest Test Pit\|Forbidden Forest Test Pit]]: "Seeing that which is hidden" 

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] works with [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Morwenna (Moira) Thorne\|Morwenna (Moira) Thorne]] to fashion the unprecedentedly aggressive [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/5.0 Ingredients/05.1 Creatures/Flask of flobberworm mucus\|flobberworm mucus]] into a [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/4.0 Potions/Sleeping Draught\|Sleeping Draught]]. With such a potent ingredient and the expert hands of a professional potioneer, the results are exceptional

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] studies the academic papers taken from [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Septimus Finch\|Septimus Finch]]'s old desk in [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.01 Cold Plant Room\|Cold Plant Room]]. They seem to focus on themes of attraction, repulsion, magnetics and proximity. Not fully understanding them she undertakes to return them to [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Jackdaw Finch\|Jackdaw Finch]] admitting their theft.

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] set out in search of the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]] and this time find it with relative ease - almost as if it was ready to be found. Entering into a seeming Broom Cupboard not too far into the disused section beyond the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.4.05 School Kitchens\|School Kitchens]] [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] thinks hard about 'requiring' a London Cheescake as evience this is the Room of Requirement, thus making one appear.

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] seek to test the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]]'s limitations. Aside from evidence that this is the right place they struggle and fail to make anything of their own choosing manifest. With the exception of a staircase - perhaps to [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.03 Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt\|8.5.03 Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt]] - which the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]] does permit them to conjure. Though possibly for reasons other than those the party intended.

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] start descending a seemingly endless staircase that appeared within the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]]. Requiring a faster way down, they lose [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] down a slide that appeared. Catching him, they manifest a landing and [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] tends [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]]'s wounds as [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] investigates a door that has appeared

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] open a door partway down the 'endless' staircase in the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]] to find just a plain brick wall beyond. A small blue mote of light, (similar in colour to the wraith-like figure that swept towards [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] from the depths beneath the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.01 Cold Plant Room\|Cold Plant Room]]) hovers through the wall and towards [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]]. As [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] casts [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Impervius\|Impervius]] on [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] the mote, becoming aggressive, fails to find any purchase on [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]]'s mind

Event:: Repelled by either or both the mental fortitude of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] and the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Impervius\|Impervius]] charm of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], a strange mote of blue light in the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]] retreats back into the wall from whence it came. The DIADEMs interpret this to be some manifestation of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)\|Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)]] attempting to contact or somehow harm or aid them.

Event:: Late into the night now, with lessons due to start in a few short hours, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] give up on reaching the bottom of the staircase and turn back towards the occupied floors of the castle. [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] wills the stairs to become shorter, which they do, however the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]] seems to refuse to permit them to leave yet

Event:: Whilst underground, and protected by the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] experience extreme ground tremors as some kind of earthquake  or localised seismic event shakes the entire foundations of the School. Held in the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]] the DIADEMs suffer no ill effects or injuries from the quake and the room seems to allow them once again to access the broom closet (and exit door) above

Event:: Returning to ground level after descending into the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|8.5.02 Room of Requirement]] in search of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.03 Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt\|8.5.03 Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] force their way out and back into the castle proper. They are greeted by a scene of extraordinary destruction, as an entire collonaded section of the castle has crumbled in the quake. Screams of terror - perhaps even of pain - can be heard coming from the occupied sections of the castle beyond
