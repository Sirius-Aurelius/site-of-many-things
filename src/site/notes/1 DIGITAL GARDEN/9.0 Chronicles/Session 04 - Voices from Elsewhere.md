Event:: The party have an opportunity to speak with [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Jackdaw Finch\|Jackdaw Finch]] about [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Septimus Finch\|Septimus Finch]]'s disappearance 8 yrs ago in the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.4 Hogwarts Valley/8.4.1.0 Forbidden Forest\|Forbidden Forest]]. Most assumed he was lost to some beast but no remains were found and Jackdaw doesn't believe. Septimus was working with Dippett, Slughorn and others to "make the forest safer for wizardkind" (controlling paths, negotiating a centaur treaty etc). They even made some progress placating the goblins who wanted to mine the area for (ancient) magic

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Jackdaw Finch\|Jackdaw Finch]] announces the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.2 Factions/07.2.15 D.I.A.D.E.M.s\|DIADEMs]] first field trip to the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.2 Factions/07.2.17 The Hogwarts Valley Mining Co.\|HVMC]]-run [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.4 Hogwarts Valley/8.4.2 Hogwarts Valley Mine\|Hogwarts Valley Mine]] in the last week before half term. He has offered the DIADEM's help in establishing their initial operation, however they'll need to learn a few tricks first

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Jackdaw Finch\|Jackdaw Finch]] gives [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] a [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/6.0 Items/Messaging Scrap\|Messaging Scrap]], which can carry short messages between it and one much like it in Jackdaw's possession

Event:: At breakfast one morning in [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.4.07 The Great Hall\|The Great Hall]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] closely observes the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.2 Factions/07.2.02 Hogwarts Faculty\|Hogwarts Faculty]] as [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Armando Dippet\|Armando Dippet]] espouses non-intervention with Muggles yet again. She strongly senses that both [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Mirabel Garlick\|Mirabel Garlick]] and [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Silvanus Kettleburn\|Silvanus Kettleburn]] are interventionist-inclined

Event:: After [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie Weasley]] empties Bernard's pouch she finds not just the galleon stolen  during [[0 DM SCREEN/2 Campaign Notes & Archive/Completed Sessions/Session 01 - Welcome to Hogwarts\|Session 01 - Welcome to Hogwarts]] but also two silver sickles. 

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] meditates on Bernard's stolen galleon. He experiences a strange vision that moves from a niffler stealing his father's cufflink, to a niffler stealing a sapphire from a dragon, to a niffler stealing an entire chandelier from the ceiling of Gringotts. In every case, no one noticed or seemed to care.

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] reveals to her friends that her family is moving to [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.5 Wider World/8.5.0 General Locations/Ottery St Catchpole\|Ottery St Catchpole]]. She gives little more detail than that.

Event:: Needing guidance on Bernard's stolen galleon, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] writes a letter to [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Newt Scamander (Magizoologist)\|Newt Scamander (Magizoologist)]]. "My name is Cassie Weasley. I know you know nifflers and the ministry gave me one. Can I stop my niffler stealing things?". She encloses the galleon in question and sends it with the *BMF Owl* - one of Hogwart's hardiest.

Event:: Her interest in him piqued, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] seeks out a [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Newt Scamander (Portrait)\|Newt Scamander (Portrait)]]. Finding a relatively new and lowly mounted frame with his name in it, he himself was not present. However a Highland Cow with an extremely prominent coiffeuse was munching joyfully in his frame

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] continues to practice her [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/1.0-2.0 RULES/1.0 Variant Rules/01.11 Potion-making\|Potion making]]. Using the ingredients obtained in the forest (plus quills from Prof. Kettleburn) she makes a standard [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/4.0 Potions/Blemish Blitzer\|Blemish Blitzer]] and using [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Horace Slughorn\|Horace Slughorn]]'s blatant favouritisim for [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] as a distraction, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] is able to whip up a [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/4.0 Potions/Fungiface Potion\|Fungiface Potion]] on the sly

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] receives an owl parcel containing an empty bottle and an exercise book. These are an Endless Vial of Moira's Reach - a family heirloom recipe - and Ma Thorne's Messaging Book.

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] join [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Jackdaw Finch\|Jackdaw Finch]] for their first formal [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.2 Factions/07.2.15 D.I.A.D.E.M.s\|DIADEMs]] lesson, learning [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Arania Exumai\|Arania Exumai]] in the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.01 Cold Plant Room\|Cold Plant Room]]. Upon arriving, they find the scenes in the 'greenhouse' windows to have changed (at Jackdaw's behest) since they were last here

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] have an opportunity to question [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Jackdaw Finch\|Jackdaw Finch]]. He is suprisingly forthcoming, having perhaps realised he cannot carry all of the weight he does alone. They learn that he has had a difficult start at Hogwarts, with the faculty resenting his [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.2 Factions/07.2.12 Ministry of Magic\|Ministry of Magic]] associations. He is an Investigator in the Department of Mysteries, tasked with - amongst other things - attending to the Hall of Prophecy. The ministry sought volunteers to embed themselves at Hogwarts to prevent strong young wizards 'going dark'. Given his desire to investigate [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Septimus Finch\|Septimus Finch]]'s disappearance, he took the role.

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Jackdaw Finch\|Jackdaw Finch]] appears as startled as [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] when [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] somehow manages to change the view outside the windows by sheer force of will. He had been experimenting with his older brother's 'settings', but had achieved nowhere near the level of control that Vi exhibits

Event:: During [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Arania Exumai\|Arania Exumai]] training, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] falls unconscious, experiencing a Seeing Eye event of unusual potency. Floating above the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.4 Hogwarts Valley/8.4.0 Hogwarts Valley - Overview\|Hogwarts Valley]] she sees the world as if it is a map made of the most fragile glass. Something ancient and powerful swells beneath the surface threatening to fracture the scene at multiple points: deep beneath Hogwarts, the road into Hogsmeade and [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.4 Hogwarts Valley/A small muggle village a few miles from the castle\|A small muggle village a few miles from the castle]]. Using some power from within her wand, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] seals the ruptures at the muggle village and the scene explodes from the other two points. An ominous portent for some as-yet-unsparked future event.

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] experiences an extremely powerful vision, beginning with the familiar sight of London ablaze in the imminent future, but then merging into something else. Something older. The scene shifts to a smaller, olden more wooden London. A fire begins to spread from an ordinary Bakers Shop across the entire city towards the towering presence of St Paul's Cathedral. The scene shifts again, this time to red-coated soldiers armed with muskets and swords marching with powder on their faces and fear in their eyes. The vision then shifts into a more... intimate... portayal of whatever this is

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] sees a young girl standing in the halls at Hogwarts. This is [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)\|Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)]], both blessed and cursed with gifts like Basil's. He sees her scrawling scenes like those he himself witnessed earlier in this vision and he witnesses a slow descent into isolation and some might say madness.

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] in his dreamlike state descends through the very bedrock beneath Hogwarts, arriving in a small, forgotten stone chamber deep beneath the castle foundations. It is a simple crypt, damp and silent. The name carved into the stone sarcophagus is **Eleonora Humblewood**. Beneath it, an epitaph reads: *Cursed with Dreamsight, Haunted by all, Blessed with Truth.* *Her visions burned bright, though the world saw only shadow.*

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] encounters the spirit of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)\|Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)]]. In a voice full of ancient sorrow she tells him: _"They did not listen... but it all came true. All of it. "Seek not to understand the future. In front lies madness. Use your gifts to discern the true past. Behind lies truth and understanding"
