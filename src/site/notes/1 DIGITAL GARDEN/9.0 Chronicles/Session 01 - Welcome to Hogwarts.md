## *Session Summary*

> The first night at Hogwarts proved to be a little overwhelming. Sorted into Hufflepuff you met a few of your fellow house members:
> - [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Finnian (Finn) O'Malley\|Finnian (Finn) O'Malley]], a softly-spoken Irish boy with siblings in just about every school year of Hogwarts,
> - [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Penelope (Penny) Perkins\|Penelope (Penny) Perkins]], a studious girl whose obsessive notetaking seemed almost reflexive,
> - [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Lily Buttercup\|Lily Buttercup]], a spacey but sweet girl who warned you all away from [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Cassian Black\|Cassian Black]], a boistrous Slytherin 3rd year whose prowess at Quidditch Captain seemed to entitle him to sneer at the entire Great Hall from the next table AND
> - [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Liam Flaherty\|Liam Flaherty]], a sturdy food-loving boy who - like you, though for very different reasons - also managed to find his way to the kitchens on his very first night at the school
> But more significantly you began to weave the first threads of friendship between one another; Basil Featherstone, Vi Thorne and Cassie Weasley. Like so many school age children you were united by circumstance. Unlike most though, your circumstance was delivered by an [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Peeves the Poltergeist\|invisible Poltergeist]] flapping a dead stuffed owl (invisible, that is, to all but one of you). It was during the course of this meeting that Cassie's baby niffler, Bernard, made a bid for freedom, coming back with a silver anklet from [[A 4th year Hufflepuff girl\|A 4th year Hufflepuff girl]] and a golden galleon from... somewhere.
> [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Peeves the Poltergeist\|Peeves]]' owl carried a note from your special needs coordinator, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Jackdaw Finch\|Professor Finch]], and led you beneath [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.4.07 The Great Hall\|The Great Hall]] to the Hogwarts [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.4.05 School Kitchens\|School Kitchens]]. There you met a handful of the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.2 Factions/07.2.18 Hogwarts Kitchen Elves\|Hogwarts Kitchen Elves]] that make the extraordinary fare throughout the year. Cassie was near force fed samples of everything from not-devilled not-eggs to an enormous leg pie, becoming known to [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Fizzy\|Fizzy]] and [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Hokey\|Hokey]] in the process. Meanwhile Basil and Vi pushed on through the kitchen to find [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Flick\|Flick]], a friend of?.. Ally of?.. *Somehow* connected to Prof Finch.
> Three linted and hairy biscuits later and each nauseated by the tug in your stomach you continued your search, wandering into a currently unused section of the castle - a dim corridor at kitchen level, not too far from the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.3.01 Hufflepuff Tower\|Hufflepuff Tower]] with several locked doors. It was here that Cassie ditched the stolen anklet in a large planter. Upon which, she and Basil promptly vomited on it.
> But you were not alone. Peeves, sensing a chance to sow some discord, bolted away to fetch [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Reginald (Reggie) Cattermole\|Mr Cattermole]], the Hogwarts caretaker and so Vi - perhaps made of sturdier stuff as a potioneer - [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Scourgify\|Scour-gified]] her friends' dinnerpile Cassie frantically sought a hiding place; Basil still some way distant as he investigated what later transpired to be your other pursuer: Flick, from the kitchens.
> Cassie, demonstrating just some of the street smarts she apparently possesses, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Alohomora\|Alohomora]]-d a door and you all stepped through just as the caretaker swept into the corridor.
> The [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.01 Cold Plant Room\|room you found yourselves in]] was dark and cold. Very cold. *Dangerously* cold it transpired. As you pondered the strange plantlife there, alive but frozen in total darkness in strange tabletop cold frames, Cassie stepped towards a wall of tiny drawers. Mere moments later, frost-coated and frankly looking half dead she advised retreat, the corridor now empty of faculty as the receding voice of Mr Cattermole could be heard reprimanding Peeves for making up the vomit incident and for stealing jewellery from a student.
> For what I expect to be the first of very many times, Vi healed her new friend and -seemingly satisfied with the display he had been secretly observing - Professor Finch untransfigured from a hairy moth into his moustachiod flyboy form and introduced himself.
> You don't know quite what he was looking for or whether he found it. You don't know what form his 'lessons' will take or what you may learn. But you do know that he gave you homework on your very first night at school and I am sure that at least one of you seethes a little as he leads you wordlessly back towards the Hufflepuff Common Room, the halls now alive with the murmurs of students as they file out of the Great Hall, the feast now over.
