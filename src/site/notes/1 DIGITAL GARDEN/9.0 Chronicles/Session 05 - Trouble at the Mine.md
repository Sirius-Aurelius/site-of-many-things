## *Session Summary*
##### AI Generated Summary
> The first half-term is rapidly drawing to a close, yet your special studies and the deepening secrets of Hogwarts ensured the final days were anything but restful.
> You began the week advancing your unique abilities and pursuing old mysteries. **Cassie**, you successfully concluded your intense training with Professor Blishwick, gaining proficiency with the Diviner's Kit. You shared your most recent, powerful vision—the map of fragile glass—with Blishwick, who confirmed that the ominous rupture you sealed was centred on **Locharbor**, a Muggle village just three miles from the castle grounds.
> Meanwhile, **Basil**, haunted by the ghostly plea of **Eleonora Humblewood** to seek the _true past_, committed deeply to investigating her life. You delved into the history of the Humblewood family, discovering that several prominent members, including a Minister of Magic, had been removed from office due to apparent mental health issues. When you deployed your Dreamweaver's Sight in contemplation of Eleonora, you were subjected to a distressing mental ambush of taunting and bullying, only managing to tear yourself back to consciousness by focusing on the thought of your mother. You awoke unconscious on the floor of the open Library, where you were found by Liam Flaherty.
> **Vi**, your dedication proved equally fruitful. Using Ma Thorne's Messaging Book, you contacted your mother, Morwenna, learning the secrets of your family heirloom spell, **Moira's Reach**, and being taught the _Exhilaro_ (Cheering Charm) to lift spirits, warning you to focus on a truly happy memory for its full effect. Your academic success was acknowledged publicly with a coveted invitation to Professor Slughorn’s prestigious **Slug Club**.
> In pursuit of Eleonora's secrets, the three of you descended to the **School Kitchens**. While **Basil** and **Vi** successfully distracted the eager-to-feed House Elf Fizzy—even helping the elves’ NPD team steer the development of a **Doughnut Plant**—**Vi** used the moment to apply **Star Grass Salve** to the nettle-stung hands of a young elf named Tinky, demonstrating your growing healing skill. Separately, **Cassie** sought out the gruff worker-elf Shonky, who suggested that the most direct path to the elusive **Eleonora Humblewood's Crypt** might be found by invoking the Room of Requirement to manifest a downward staircase.
> All research was shattered by an urgent summons from Professor Finch, calling you immediately to the **HVMC test pit** in the Forbidden Forest. You found the site compromised: **five British paratroopers** were examining the 'Illusory Dome' Kiko had erected to deter Muggle curiosity.
> The confrontation was swift and violent.
> - **Cassie** initiated a brilliant piece of theatre, feigning distress to draw the soldiers out, briefly phasing through the dome to glimpse the mysterious mining equipment before snapping back. When gunfire erupted, you quickly countered, using _**Wingardium Leviosa**_ to disarm the leader.
> - **Basil** unleashed two spells in rapid succession: your rifle-sounding _**Devicto**_, followed by your first ever attempt at _**Periculum**_, sending a distress flare high into the sky, successfully drawing four soldiers into the treeline.
> - **Vi** followed this up with a potent concentration of familial magic, unleashing a powerful **Moira's Reached** blast of _**Aguamenti**_ that pinned one soldier to the ground and repelled two others.
> The action abruptly halted with the arrival of Professor Finch and the Goblin Engineer, Kiko. While Jackdaw began the delicate task of casting _Obliviate_, Kiko, taking matters into his own hands, used a devastating dark magic technique—which you witnessed as **"Finger-of-Death bullshit"**—to **instantly kill the Lieutenant**.
> A visibly furious Jackdaw Finch ordered you to prevent the remaining Muggles from escaping. Once they were contained, he swiftly tweaked the memories of the survivors before **Disapparating** immediately to report the horrific incident to the Ministry of Magic. He left you standing there, the scent of gunpowder and blood fouling the Forbidden Forest air, ignoring **Cassie’s** frantic pleas to "tidy up" the mortal casualty by other means.

---

>You are now standing at the edge of the **HVMC test pit** in the Forbidden Forest, the newly deceased lieutenant lying tragically nearby, and the forest creatures beginning to stir, drawn by the scent of blood and unexpected magical violence.

>**The path to the mine—and the truth—is now open, but what do you do with the body and the survivors, before the Ministry's damage control arrives?**

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] contacts her mother using the Messenger Book. She learns about Moira's Reach and how it came to be, proudly tells her mother about her invitation to joint [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.2 Factions/07.2.13 The Slug Club\|07.2.13 The Slug Club]] and asks her mother about treatments for mental health disorders

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Morwenna (Moira) Thorne\|Morwenna (Moira) Thorne]] teaches [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] via letter the spell [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Exhilaro\|Exhilaro]] "*That brings me to another thought. Healing isn’t always about mending bones, my love. Sometimes it’s about lifting a spirit. There is a simple but wonderfully effective charm I want you to learn: the Cheering Charm, **[[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Exhilaro\|Exhilaro]]**. "The incantation is straightforward, and the wand movement is a gentle, uplifting flick. The key is intent. A simple desire to bring a moment of joy will make a person feel cheerful and give them heart against their fears. But if you concentrate, if you channel a truly happy memory—much like aurors do for a Patronus—the effect is far more potent. It can send the target into incapacitating fits of laughter. It is a fine charm to practice, though perhaps try it on a cushion before you try it on Plop. And remember your potions; should you ever overdo it, a simple [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/4.0 Potions/Draught of Peace\|Draught of Peace]] is the perfect counteragent!"*

He tells her that it is quite rare to see yourself from outside (as she and [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] both do), *even rarer* to see the world from above - usually it is from eye-level as if by another observer in the place.

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Myrddin Blishwick\|Myrddin Blishwick]] identifies the village in [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]]'s 'affected vision' as being [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.4 Hogwarts Valley/Locharbor\|Locharbor]], 3 miles from the castle grounds here in the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.4 Hogwarts Valley/8.4.0 Hogwarts Valley - Overview\|Hogwarts Valley]].

She tells him that the entirety of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.2.0 Hogwarts School - Overview\|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry]] is anti-cartographical. Only the main areas of the school are plottable and even some of them seem resistant to being pinned down.

Haunted by taunting and bullying, ring-a-roses and namecalling he turned his thoughts first to the recent [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Arania Exumai\|Arania Exumai]] training session and turned his tormentors into unsighted spiders. But switching his thoughts to his mother has was able to pull himself back to consciousness.

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Liam Flaherty\|Liam Flaherty]] finds [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] unconscious on the floor of the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.4.03.1 School Library - Open Section\|School Library (open section)]] after his Dreamweaver encounter with [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)\|Eleonora Humblewood (dec.)]]
