## *Session Summary*
### When last we met
###### AI-Generated Summmary:
> Your first night at Hogwarts began with you exploring the Hufflepuff Common Room and Dormitories, with the password "Helga's Children." Here, you also encountered the portrait of Helga Hufflepuff.
> Cassie Weasley attempted to get an autograph from fellow Hufflepuff, Lily Buttercup, for her aunt Brenda "The Bruiser" Buttercup, but Lily refused, and Basil Featherstone sensed there was more to the story. Vi Thorne offered to be a study buddy to Penelope "Penny" Perkins, another Hufflepuff first-year, who was eager to accept. Cassie, with Vi's eventual help, convinced Penny to do homework from Professor Jackdaw Finch (assigned in Session 1), only to find it wasn't required. Penny then expressed a strong desire to become a D.I.A.D.E.M. herself.
> While in the Common Room, Basil experienced a vivid vision of a "busy War Room" through the face of a medieval barber surgeon, accompanied by a feeling of urgency for studiousness. He later shared a past vision of his mother's illness coming true, and revealed that his father, Major Rudolph Augustus Featherstone DSO MC (Ret.), was a Muggle-born WWI hero who discovered magic later in life. Basil also sent a letter home to his father via his owl, Selene. His wand, made of Redwood (attracted to those who "fall on their feet"), with a Dragon Heartstring core (for powerful, dynamic magic and ambitious wizards), and a length of 14 inches (haunted by dreams of the future), reflects his nature as a "Dreamer" who receives prophetic visions.
> You met your Head of House, Professor Mirabel Garlick, the acting Herbology Professor for eight years. She explained this was due to Septimus Finch (Jackdaw's brother and Agnes Finch's great-uncle) disappearing from the Forbidden Forest while researching potent potions and genetically modifying Star Grass. Cassie was docked 5 House Points by Professor Garlick for rudeness about Jackdaw Finch.
> Cassie confidently revealed her rare Elder Wand to Basil and Vi. Both Cassie and Basil then shared their increasingly vivid visions of an impending war, with Cassie specifically seeing barrage balloons over London and planes with swastika tail fins. Cassie possesses innate divination abilities, manifesting as practical insights and chilling flashes of conflict.
> You attended early lessons, including Defence Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, History of Magic, and Astronomy. Cassie was disappointed to find the Quidditch arena mothballed and no tryouts scheduled until after the October half-term, as Professor Cirrus Vane was on an "extended summer break".
> In Charms class with Professor Elara Bourne, you learned Wingardium Leviosa (Cassie earning 5 Hufflepuff points for teamwork) and Lumos & Nox (Cassie and Vi). Basil, already proficient, received advanced tuition from Professor Bourne, learning Flagrate and receiving an open invitation for further mentorship, even in Jinxes, Hexes, and Curses "when he's a little bit older."
> Your first Potions class with Professor Horace Slughorn was particularly impactful. You learned the recipe for Antidote of Common Poisons. While Basil and Cassie brewed flawed versions, Vi impressively produced three standard quality potions from poor ingredients. Slughorn, highly impressed, offered to teach Vi any Extra-curricular Common Potion, providing ingredients and mentorship, and extended an open invitation for her to use the Potions classroom for her own brews. He also hinted at future invitations to his prestigious Slug Club for all three of you after the October half-term.
> Finally, Cassie was invited to the Divination Tower by Professor Myrddin Blishwick. There, she began to learn about Tasseomancy and Cleromancy, two branches of divination. Cassie shared her concerns about the upcoming conflict, and Professor Blishwick confirmed he had similar visions. He offered Cassie Diviner's Kit proficiency training and mentorship, even before Divination becomes an elective. A Diviner's Kit is essential for these abilities, with a 33% chance of failure without proficiency.
