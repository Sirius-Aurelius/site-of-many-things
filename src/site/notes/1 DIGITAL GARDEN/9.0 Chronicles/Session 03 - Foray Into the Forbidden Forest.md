## *Session Summary*
###### AI generated summary
> The initial shock of your first week quickly gave way to a relentless academic schedule, as the Ministry’s special attention transformed into dedicated mentorships. **Cassie Weasley** diligently began formal Divination training with Professor Myrddin Blishwick, delving into the mysteries of Tasseomancy and Cleromancy to sharpen her already potent insights into the coming conflict. Meanwhile, **Vi Thorne**, seizing the generous invitation from Professor Slughorn, embarked on practical extra-curricular Potions work, learning the restorative recipe for **Pet Tonic**.

>However, the wider world pressed its concerns ever closer: reports surfaced in _The Daily Prophet_ of 22 key removals from the Ministry of Magic for "conduct unbecoming," signaling internal turmoil, while news of Muggle evacuees and escalating military training near magical sites prompted Headmaster Dippet and Professor Blight to urge "constant vigilance!". Amidst this global tension, **Basil Featherstone** was plagued by another vivid vision: suited, grey drone people vanishing into a red telephone box while elaborately dressed wizards were simultaneously ejected from the opposite side—a chilling symbol of the mounting collision between the two worlds.

>Driven by a need for historical context, especially regarding the unsettling disappearance of Herbology Professor Septimus Finch, the trio sought answers among the portraits lining the ancient **Wall of Heroes**. Before chaos could erupt, Basil finally put a stop to the Caretaker’s tormentor, successfully casting _Stupefy_ on **Peeves the Poltergeist**. But Peeves, determined to have his revenge, ambushed the group at the Wall, throwing a vial of **billywig stings** at Basil just as he attempted to use _Wingardium Leviosa_ on Cassie to reach a high portrait.

>Basil began to levitate uncontrollably before falling, grabbing desperately at the frames of legendary witches. Dangling mid-air, he managed a glimpse of the portrait of **Elladora Ketteridge**, famed discoverer of Gillyweed, before plummeting to the floor, fracturing his ankle despite Vi’s quick, defensive spellcraft. The accident necessitated an immediate trip to the **Hospital Wing**, where Vi rigorously observed Madam Willow mend Basil's broken bone using the painful _Brackium Emendo_ spell. It was here the trio learned a dangerous secret: **Madam Willow** herself had served three days in Azkaban for her involvement in the **Wizarding Interventionist Unit**, a rebel group that openly defied the International Statute of Secrecy during the last great war.

>The ultimate test arrived unexpectedly during a volatile joint Potions and Herbology class with the Slytherins, leading to a live foray into the **Forbidden Forest**. This environment immediately proved uneasy, bordering on wrong: **Cassie** earned a moment of dark satisfaction by cunningly tripping Slytherin **Marcus Muldoon** directly into Professor Slughorn, before the designated 'elite' gathering set out for rare ingredients. Led by Vi’s toad, Plop, Vi and Cassie plunged down a hillside in pursuit of **Flobberworms**, finding them inexplicably aggressive and oddly hostile. Meanwhile, Basil was beset by unusually ferocious **Gnomes** on the high ground. The trio united in a fierce, unconventional defense: Vi unleashed a potent blast of _Aguamenti_, while Cassie expertly utilized a "muggleball kick" to dispatch the vicious gnomes into the canopy.

>As the three realized the deep unease unsettling the forest’s magical ecosystem, Professor **Jackdaw Finch** untransfigured from his moth form and approached the group looking stern, seemingly marking the conclusion of his latest strange test.
