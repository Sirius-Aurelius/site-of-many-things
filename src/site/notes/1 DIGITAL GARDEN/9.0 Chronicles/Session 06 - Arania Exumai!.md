## *Session Summary*
##### AI Generated Summary
> The first half-term is nearly done, but your work as **D.I.A.D.E.M.s** has ramped up the intensity, plunging you straight into action and uncovering deep secrets that seem to link at least one of your families directly to the heart of Hogwarts' mysteries.
> Last session, you answered a call to arms, heading back to the Forbidden Forest to assist Kiko, the Goblin Engineer, at the Hogwarts Valley Mining Co's Forbidden Forest Test Pit - one of at least 7 that have sprung up in the Hogwarts Valley since the recent and unprecedented cooperation agreement signed between the Headmaster, the Ministry and the Goblin authorities. **Vi, your unique, but unexplained, connection to the castle’s Ancient Magic proved instantly invaluable**, as you sensed the illusory dome hiding the mine entrance, a skill Kiko confirmed was rare and powerful.
> Leading the charge into Test Pit 7, you successfully cleared the chamber of **Acromantula and Giant Spiders**, demonstrating remarkable bravery and resourcefulness on your first true combat mission. While securing the perimeter, Vi skillfully gathered unexpected, subtropical ingredients, including Angel's trumpet, hinting that something strange is happening to the forest’s magical ecosystem. You then made a strategic withdrawal, using the Messaging Scrap to communicate back to **Jackdaw Finch**—now desperately "smoothing things over" at the Ministry—who warned you to "Speak to no one on your way back to the castle".
> Your hunger for answers led you back into Hogwarts, diligently hitting the library to hunt down leads on Eleonora Humblewood and the arcane. Cassie confirmed that the elusive **Room of Requirement** was last reported as a mere lavatory eighty years ago.
> The biggest breakthrough, however, occurred back in the dimly-lit **Cold Plant Room**. You investigated the strange latrine-like chest and discovered a **mysterious crystal**, identical to those you saw deep within the mine shaft
>In a moment of pure, unplanned magic:
>- **Vi bravely engaged the Ancient Magic directly by touching the crystal**, getting jolted backwards and electrocuted by a lurking conjured spider, forcing a swift _Episkey_ spell to mend the damage.
>- But in that instant, **Cassie shared a profound, sudden memory**—a vision of Vi as a young child being cared for by her mother, Morwenna Thorne, who applied Star Grass Salve to a scraped knee. This intensely personal bond was interwoven with the raw magic of the crystal, urging you both to ponder the true nature of this ancient power.
>Seizing the momentum, **Cassie the Troublemaker broke into Professor Finch's desk**, and the revelations came tumbling out:
>- You discovered a paper **co-written by the missing Septimus Finch and Vi’s own mother, Morwenna Thorne**, titled _On The Properties of Star Grass_. The threads of this mystery are tightening and connecting right to your families!
>- You also secured valuable, coded papers from Septimus and discovered **Jackdaw Finch's true first name is Titus**.
>- Most ominously, you intercepted personal correspondence revealing that Alastair Thorpe-Wick, the Head of the Department of Mysteries, sternly ordered Jackdaw/Titus to **"Give up on Septimus. Concentrate on your mission. The children must not fall into darkness"**.
>- The Ministry is clearly concerned about you, your Head of House's missing brother may be somehow distantly connected to one of your home lives, and you now possess the knowledge and papers he left behind. The first term is all but over, but the dangerous secrets of Hogwarts have only just begun to unfold, and your influence in events yet to come do not need Cassie's divination talents to realise is undeniable.

[[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] give Basil a cautious and consensual 'swirly' to see what lies down there
