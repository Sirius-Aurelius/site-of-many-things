## *Session Summary*

### AI-Generated Recap
> When last we met...
> We began immediately following the **extreme ground tremors** that violently shook the foundations of the school. Our Hufflepuff trio returned to the collapsed corridor outside the School Kitchens. Vi aided House Elves in putting out a fire, noting that her own magic was highly unstable, causing random effects like conjuring coins or giving Cassie a _Periculum_-red glow.
>
>In the ruined kitchens, chaos reigned:
>
>- Cassie freed **Liam Flaherty** from beneath a butcher’s block using _Vera Verto_ to transmute its weight.
>- The magical **Doughnut Plant** went wildly out of control, forcing House Elves to flee. Basil partially deflated it with _Devicto_, and Cassie and Vi stopped its expansion using _Accio_ and salt, during which Vi experienced another magical misfire.
>- An accidental spell cast by the House Elf **Shonky** summoned a **swarm of Cornish Pixies** that attacked and knocked Cassie unconscious. **Vi bravely threw herself upon Cassie**, maintaining a _Protego_ shield while successfully restoring consciousness via _Episkey_. Basil paddled the Pixies away with a chopping board, and Cassie ultimately disarmed the swarm using _Digitus Wibbly_.
>
>Headmaster Dippet quickly summoned residents to the Great Hall to coordinate the investigation. Cassie seized this moment to relate her prophetic "glass-map" vision to Jackdaw Finch (seemingly within Dippet's hearing), confirming her knowledge of *Specialis Revelio*. As Cassie unloaded her worries, Jackdaw tried to reassure her: she had "not condemned two places, but *saved* one," referring to Locharbor, the nearby Muggle village. Dippet immediately tasked the trio with finding Professor Mirabel Garlick, who had rushed to the Herbology Greenhouses. Cassie also received a portrait reply from Newt Scamander regarding her Niffler, Bernard: "Return everything with someone's name on and keep the rest!".
>
>At the headmaster's request, the trio proceeded to the **Herbology Greenhouses** as instructed, finding the plants growing wildly. They encountered a dangerous hybrid of Venomous Tentacula and Devil's Snare, which they evaded using _Lumos_. They found Professor Garlick trapped near a hazardous experimental plant cultivated by Slytherin NEWT student Sean Perton. After Vi's magic misfired while attempting an _Accio_ on a sentient **Thaumatagoria** plant, Basil attacked the plant with _Devicto_ to protect a Mandrake root. Garlick eventually contained the dangerously overgrown flora and ordered the students out.
>Outside thegrrenhouses, Vi plucked up the courage to intentionally touch the mysterious **crystal** stolen from Septimus Finch's Cold Plant Room desk, causing her physical body to fall inert while her consciousness was pulled into a deep inner vision. During which
>
>1. Vi travelled through a timeless void toward a Strange & Ornate Vanity Unit.
>2. Basil used _Flagrate_ in the real world to communicate, prompting Vi to respond with silent _Lumos_ and _Nox_ signals from her body.
>3. Vi guided Cassie to cast _Alohomora_ on the vision's mirror, allowing her consciousness to access a cavernous underground workshop.
>4. Vi briefly glimpsed an **Ancient Goblin Artificer/Engineer** muttering about "**another failed attempt**".
>5. When the Artificer threw a substance at the crystal, Basil intervened, wresting the crystal away from Vi's hand (which had been loosened by Cassie casting _Digitus Wibbly_ in the real world) just before Vi awoke,.
>
>The trio deduced a clear link between **Ancient Magic**, the powerful disturbances, and Vi's inherent abilities, recognizing that the area beneath the Room of Requirement likely used this same ancient power. Finally, climbing the Clock and Divination Towers, they observed widespread magical disturbances, including the Black Lake violently roiling. 
>
>Most dramatically, they witnessed an **ENORMOUS sinkhole (100ft in diameter) that had completely swallowed the road leading to Hogsmeade Village**. Basil subsequently gained one level of exhaustion from the continuous stress.

In helping them, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] realises that her own magic, whilst still casting from her wand, is augmented by random additional effects - conjuring coins, a temporary [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/1.0-2.0 RULES/1.0 Variant Rules/01.09 Wizarding Feats#Veela Charm\|Veela Charm]], giving [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] a [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Periculum OR Verdimillious\|Periculum-red]] glow for about 13 minutes.

As both spells once again trigger a random magical side effect for Vi nothing too awful befalls them.

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] demonstrates commendable cricket skills as he chopping-board-paddles a dozen [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/10.0 CREATURES/WW Bestiary/Pixie (Cornish)\|Pixie]]s

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] removes all but one of the pesky [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/10.0 CREATURES/WW Bestiary/Pixie (Cornish)\|Pixies]], using [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Digitus Wibbly\|Digitus Wibbly]] which affected their wings as much as their fingers

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]], still covering the recently-recovered [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], is attacked by the last remaining [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/10.0 CREATURES/WW Bestiary/Pixie (Cornish)\|Pixie (Cornish)]].

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] reveals to both [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Jackdaw Finch\|Jackdaw Finch]] and [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Armando Dippet\|Armando Dippet]] that she knows [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Specialis Revelio\|Specialis Revelio]]. She did not explain specifically that this is somehow attributable to her [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)#Cassie's Wand\|Elder Wand]]. 

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Jackdaw Finch\|Jackdaw Finch]] reassures [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] that "if you truly can exert some influence over events consider that a blessing. You did not condemn two places, but saved one. And a noble one at that." (in reference to [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.4 Hogwarts Valley/Locharbor\|Locharbor]]). Cassie remains troubled by the undeniably troubling events however.

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Armando Dippet\|Armando Dippet]] requests the help of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] in locating and retrieving [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Mirabel Garlick\|Mirabel Garlick]] who rushed to the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.2.01 Herbology Greenhouses\|Herbology Greenhouses]] to check on her plantlife charges

"Nifflers do as nifflers will. Return everything with someone's name on and keep the rest!"

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] head to the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.2.01 Herbology Greenhouses\|Herbology Greenhouses]] in the aftermath of the seismic events of October 1939 in search of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Mirabel Garlick\|Prof. Garlick]]. They find all of the plants to be growing wildly and exhibiting strange behaviour

Event:: In one of the ancillary (upper year) [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.2.01 Herbology Greenhouses\|Herbology Greenhouses]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] encounter a strange hybrid of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/11.0 Plants/Venomous Tentacula\|Venomous Tentacula]] and [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/11.0 Plants/Devil's Snare\|Devil's Snare]].

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] casts her [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/6.0 Items/Grindylow Bones\|Grindylow Bones]] to help Vi divine a way to access the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.2.01 Herbology Greenhouses\|Herbology Greenhouses]] and find [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Mirabel Garlick\|Prof. Garlick]]

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] hear [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Mirabel Garlick\|Prof. Garlick]] from afar, saying she is caught in a large and dangerous plant. The project of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Sean Perton\|Sean Perton]], a Slytherin NEWT student of hers.

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] interacts with a strange variation of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/11.0 Plants/Thaumatagoria\|Thaumatagoria]] - a sentient plant that, when Vi tries to [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Accio\|Accio]] some earmuffs and her magic misfires, seems to try to prevent her doing so. 

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] fires [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Devicto\|Devicto]] into the strange [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/11.0 Plants/Thaumatagoria\|Thaumatagoria]]-like plant in the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.2.01 Herbology Greenhouses\|Herbology Greenhouses]] after it reaches to unpot a [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/5.0 Ingredients/05.1 Plants/Mandrake root\|Mandrake root]]. Seemingly angered, the plant reacts by targeting [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] with the Mandrake.

Event:: Making some headway in communicating with the wildly overgrowing plants in the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.2.01 Herbology Greenhouses\|Herbology Greenhouses]], Vi is interrupted by [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Mirabel Garlick\|Prof. Garlick]] ordering them all out as she is about to cut her way out. Vi grabs [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1.1 Pets/Mandrake (Vi's mandrake)\|Mandrake (Vi's mandrake)]] and books it to safety with Cassie & Basil. The party leave the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.2.01 Herbology Greenhouses\|Herbology Greenhouses]] and head into the small 'garden' space between it and the main castle.

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] deduce a probable connection between Ancient Magic, the natural magic of the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.4 Hogwarts Valley/8.4.1.0 Forbidden Forest\|Forbidden Forest]], the power of the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.2 Factions/07.2.18 Hogwarts Kitchen Elves\|Hogwarts Kitchen Elves]], the plants in the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.2.01 Herbology Greenhouses\|Herbology Greenhouses]] and [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Viola Thorne]] herself. That the area around the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|Room of Requirement]] seemed so affected by the seismic event raises the question of whether that may utilise the same ancient magic too

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] touches the crystal [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] stole from [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Septimus Finch\|Septimus Finch]]'s weird chest in the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.01 Cold Plant Room\|Cold Plant Room]]. Her body is outwardly calm and peaceful but [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] and [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] are unable to rouse her. Cassie nudges the inert [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] with a foot before casting a 'safe' spell on the crystal ([[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Alohomora\|Alohomora]])

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]]'s conciousness is transported to an endless, timeless void. After what could be a moment or an eternity, a small pinprick of red light appears in the distance as a sense of space and geometry returns. Vi wills herself towards it, revealing a [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/6.0 Items/Strange & Ornate Vanity Unit\|Strange & Ornate Vanity Unit]] with a matching stool and a mirror surrounded by red bulbs. In the mirror is a vision of a long, dark tunnel

Event:: Willing herself 'into' the scene in the mirror, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]]'s consciousness enters into a long, dank tunnel deep underground somewhere loamy. Travelling along it she finds the same [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/6.0 Items/Strange & Ornate Vanity Unit\|Strange & Ornate Vanity Unit]]. This time the mirror shows a vision of her own inert body back at the school with [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] and [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]]. As [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] nudges Vi with her foot, the entire tunnel swings and snakes wildly, throwing Vi off her feet.

Event:: Recognising the connection between body and mind, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] cleverly uses [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Flagrate\|Flagrate]] to communicate with [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]]. Vi used [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Lumos & Nox\|Lumos & Nox]] to respond, as spells cast (wandlessly) within the 'vision'/'dream'/whatever-this-was seemed to have no effect there, but did affect her body in the 'real' world

Event:: With rudimentary communication established, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] collectively get the mirror in [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]]'s mind to spin, revealing a reverse image of a door, which Cassie [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Alohomora\|Alohomora]]s from the real world as Vi strobes brightly on and off in yes/no communication.

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]]'s consciousness steps through the mirror and arrives in a cavernous undergrouns workshop. A mix of mundane, magical and muggle devices dotted around. [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] glimpses an [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Ancient Goblin Artificer\|Ancient Goblin Artificer]] or Engineer or something and hears him mutter "*another failed attempt. I suppose I shall have to try again then, perhaps elsewhere*"

Event:: The [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Ancient Goblin Artificer\|Ancient Goblin Artificer]] senses [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]]'s consciousness intruding and as it turns and throws something at her - a potion or liquid of some kind. As it splashes over the crystal - now somehow in the hands of her unconscious self here Vi is transported in the blink of an eye to a dark field or meadow. All senses return, as if she is back in the real world until she is again torn away a split second later, this time by [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]]

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] wrestles the crystal from [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]]'s grip, weakened by [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]]'s familiar use of [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Digitus Wibbly\|Digitus Wibbly]] (causing it to 'appear' in the other realm where Vi's consciousness resided, for her to hold out before the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.3 NPCs/Ancient Goblin Artificer\|Ancient Goblin Artificer]])

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] awakens, obviously disturbed, but seemingly whole. Concerned, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] escort her back to the castle, but the pull of adventure is strong and they instead climb the [[Clock Tower\|Clock Tower]] and the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.2.11 Divination Tower\|Divination Tower]] to look upon [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.4 Hogwarts Valley/Locharbor\|Locharbor]] and the road to [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.3 Hogsmeade Village/8.3.01 Hogsmeade Village - Overview\|Hogsmeade Village]] in particular

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] observes the landscape and identifies ancient magical disturbances (if that is what they are) in: The [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.4 Hogwarts Valley/8.4.1.0 Forbidden Forest\|Forbidden Forest]] (where sparks and lights flare upwards and downwards seemingly at random), the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.2.01 Herbology Greenhouses\|Herbology Greenhouses]] which are running rampant, the disused wing around the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.5.02 Room of Requirement\|Room of Requirement]] and towards the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.4.05 School Kitchens\|School Kitchens]] and also the [[Black Lake\|Black Lake]] which is roiling and rolling as if shaken from below

Event:: [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]], [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] see for themselves the ENORMOUS sinkhole that has swallowed the road from [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.2 Hogwarts School/8.2.0 Hogwarts School - Overview\|Hogwarts School]] to [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/8.0 PLACES/8.3 Hogsmeade Village/8.3.01 Hogsmeade Village - Overview\|Hogsmeade Village]]. Easily 100ft in diameter it sinks to a depth unseeable from the castle. Determining to get some sleep, [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Cassie Weasley (Karima)\|Cassie]] & [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Vi Thorne (Charlie)\|Vi]] manage it, but [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/7.0 PEOPLE/7.1 PCs/Basil Featherstone (Nick)\|Basil]] gains 1 level of exhaustion
