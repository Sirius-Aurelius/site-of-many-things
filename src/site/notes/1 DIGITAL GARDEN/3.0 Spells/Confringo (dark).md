The Blasting Curse - 3rd-level Curse
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Duration: Instantaneous

A tiny ball of fire flashes from your wand to a point you choose within range and then explodes into a fiery blast on impact. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that arenâ€™t worn or carried.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 and the radius increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.
