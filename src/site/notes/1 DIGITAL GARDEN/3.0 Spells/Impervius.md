The Waterproofing Charm - Charm cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 1 hour 

For the duration, a target object that you can see within range is waterproof and completely protected from any gas. It's as if any liquid or gas runs into a magnetic field around the object by which it is repelled, but the spell has no effect against solids impacting the target object.
