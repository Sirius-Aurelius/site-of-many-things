The Locking Spell - Charm cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Touch 
Duration: Until dispelled 

You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. It is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.
