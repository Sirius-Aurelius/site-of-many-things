The Anti-Disapparition Jinx - 5th-level Curse 
Casting Time: 10 minutes 
Range: Self (60-foot-radius sphere) 
Duration: 8 hours 

Commonly used by the Department of Magical Law enforcement, this wards an area against apparition or disapparition. No one may arrive in the warded area via apparition, nor may any creatures within the warded area cast the spell. Any attempt to do so results in the typical apparition effect, except the creature stays exactly where they are. 

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 60 feet for each slot level above 5th.
