The Singing Jinx - Curse cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Duration: 1 round 

When struck by this spell, a being can't help but belt out a couple of lines from the first song that comes to mind. Make a ranged spell attack against a being within range. On a hit, the target must cast all other spells non-verbally until the end of its next turn. If it tries to cast a spell verbally, it must first succeed on an Intelligence saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell is wasted.
