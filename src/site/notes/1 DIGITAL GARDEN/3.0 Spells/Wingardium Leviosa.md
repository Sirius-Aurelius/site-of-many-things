The Levitation Charm - Charm cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Duration: ==Dedication==, up to 1 minute

One creature other than yourself or object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. 

The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 100 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target’s altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell’s range.

If the spell is ended voluntarily, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft. If ended involuntarily, the target immediately drops.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the weight limit is increased by 150 pounds for each slot level above 0.
