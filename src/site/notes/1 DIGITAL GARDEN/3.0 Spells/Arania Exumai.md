The Spider Repelling Spell - 2nd-level Curse 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self (30 foot cone) 
Duration: Instantaneous 

This spell blasts away spiders, Acromantulas, or arachnids with a cone of bright scorching light. Each spider-like creature in a 30-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 radiant damage and is knocked back 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't knocked back. Any non-arachnid creatures within the area of the spell are unaffected. 

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 and the shove distance increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.
