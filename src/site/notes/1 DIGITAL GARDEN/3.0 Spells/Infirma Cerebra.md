The Jelly-Brain Jinx - Curse cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Duration: 1 round 

This jinxes a target's mind, giving them a brief moment of disorientation. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature within range. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 psychic damage, and the first time it makes a saving throw before the end of your next turn, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the save. 

This spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels: 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
