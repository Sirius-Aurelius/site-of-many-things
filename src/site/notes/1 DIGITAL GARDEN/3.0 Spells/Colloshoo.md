The Stickfast Hex - 1st-level Curse 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 90 feet 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 

This creative hex sticks a being's shoes to the ground, rooting them in place. Choose a being you can see within range that is wearing shoes to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target is restrained for the duration. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is knocked prone as well. The target can use its action to take off its shoes, or make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it pulls its shoes free.
