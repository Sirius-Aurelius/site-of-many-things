The Bubble-Head Charm - 3rd-level Charm (ritual) 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 24 hours 

Accurately named, the bubble-head charm forms a large bubble-like mask over a creature's mouth, nose, and ears that is magically filled with never-ending fresh air. This spell grants one willing creature you can see within range the ability to breathe underwater or in a vacuum until the spell ends.

Additionally, the creature is immune to poison damage due to inhalation for the duration. The creature can dispel this effect using an action.
