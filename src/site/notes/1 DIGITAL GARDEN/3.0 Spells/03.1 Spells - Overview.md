# Magic in the Wizarding World

Magic in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter is fluid and flexible, constrained only by a wizard's knowledge and experience. Some spells depend entirely on specific emotions, while others demand mental focus and precise wand movements. Spellcasting is a highly personal endeavor, allowing different witches to develop their own unique styles and repertoires.

Given that Wands & Wizards focuses exclusively on spellcasters, particular attention has been paid to how spells function. Not all spells are lethal, enabling wizards and witches to engage in the non-lethal combat expected within wizarding society. 

## Spellcasting

### Damaging Spells

Many spells inflict some form of damage. However, because magic is intricately linked to a spell's intent, the effect on the target can vary significantly. Spells can be either lethal or non-lethal. Many dueling spells are designed to be non-lethal, whereas violent, combative Dark magic is fatal.

### Non-Lethal Magic

==A creature cannot be killed by standard spells==, regardless of the caster's intent. If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by a standard spell (and fails all death saving throws, if applicable), that creature will be knocked out non-lethally.

### Lethal Magic

Dark spells differ from regular spells in one crucial aspect: damage dealt by Dark spells is potentially lethal. If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by a Dark spell (and fails all death saving throws, if applicable), that creature dies. It is possible to use damaging Dark spells to injure a creature, and then finish them off with a damaging spell that isn’t Dark, to non-lethally incapacitate it.

### Duration

Wands & Wizards adheres to all standard 5e rules and conventions regarding spell duration and concentration. However, the inclusion of dedication spells necessitates more strategic use of certain spells.

### Dedication (Concentration+)

If a spell's Duration entry marks it as a 'dedication' spell, you must maintain concentration on that spell ==and use an action at the start of each of your turns to maintain your dedication==. Losing dedication ends the spell. Similar to concentration, you can end dedication at any time without an action.

The following factors can break dedication:
* **Casting another spell.** This applies regardless of whether the other spell requires dedication. Even using a bonus action to cast another spell will result in lost dedication.
* **Losing your line of sight to your target.** This only applies if your spell affects a specific target; you cannot lose dedication by losing line of sight to area spells.
* **Losing concentration.** If your concentration is broken by taking damage or being incapacitated, your dedication is also broken.

### Ritual Casting
The concept of ritual casting does exist within this universe. Standard D&D 5e rules apply: 

>*If you have a spell prepared that has the Ritual tag, you can cast that spell as a Ritual. 
>The Ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.*

## Dark Spells

The Dark Arts, also known as Dark magic, refers to any type of magic primarily used to cause harm, exert control over, or even kill a victim. This encompasses many spells and actions, from powerful Unforgivable Curses to brewing harmful or poisonous potions and breeding Dark creatures, many of which are often illegal or discouraged. Practicing certain Dark magics is rumored to damage a wizard’s soul and requires malicious intent to cast. However, despite being labeled “dark,” the Dark Arts are not necessarily “evil,” as many prominent wizards and Aurors have used Dark spells in dire circumstances to fulfill their duty.

Due to their lethal effects, using Dark spells on beings will draw attention to your character and may cause people to question their motivations and loyalties. If the Dark tag is accompanied by "Unforgivable," it signifies an Unforgivable Curse, which is illegal under all circumstances and guarantees a life sentence in Azkaban. Casting Unforgivable Curses or killing a being with a Dark spell should prompt a corruption roll, as outlined in [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/1.0-2.0 RULES/1.0 Variant Rules/01.12 Dark Magic Corruption\|01.12 Dark Magic Corruption]].

## School of Magic Spells

A school of magic spell is a spell that cannot be learned through usual methods (*spells marked with \* in the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/03.1 Spells - Overview#Schools of Magic\|below list]]. These spells are granted by a school of magic whenever you gain a spell slot of that spell's level. Once gained, a school of magic spell is added to your spells known, does not count against your total number of spells known, and cannot be forgotten to learn another spell.

## Targets

### Being

A Being is one of three classifications used by the Ministry of Magic to catalogue the various magical Creatures that inhabit the wizarding world (the others being Beast and Spirit). The definition of a Being is any creature that has sufficient intelligence to understand the laws of the magical community and to bear part of the responsibility in shaping those laws.

All humans are beings, as are goblins, vampires, hags, giants, house-elves, veela, werewolves, merpeople and centaurs. Dementors, boggarts and poltergeists are neither Beings nor Beasts, as they are Non-Beings.

### Object

An object is simply an inanimate object. Movement, imitations of life, or even intelligent speech should not deceive you, as many enchantments and bewitched objects in the magical world can make an inanimate object quite animate. Never trust something that thinks if you don’t see a place for its brain.

### Spirit

The Spirit classification was created when ghosts protested that classifying them as "beings" was insensitive, given their status as "has-beens". They have frequently expressed dissatisfaction with governments prioritizing the concerns of the living over those of the dead.
