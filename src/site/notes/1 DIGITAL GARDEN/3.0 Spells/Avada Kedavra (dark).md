The Killing Curse - 8th-level Curse 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Duration: Instantaneous 

The most dangerous of the Unforgivables, Avada Kedavra channels the caster's pure hatred into an unblockable spell that kills whatever it strikes. Make a ranged spell attack against a target within range. On a hit and if the target has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies or is destroyed. Otherwise, the spell has no effect. Defensive spells have no effect against this spell and it can only be blocked by physical objects. 

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, there is no hit point restriction.
