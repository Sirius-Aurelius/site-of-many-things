The Human-Presence-Revealing Spell - 4th-level Divination 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self (60 foot sphere) 
Duration: Instantaneous 

You sense the presence and general direction of each human or magical being within range. If any being is moving, you know its direction. If the being is transfigured into a beast or object, this spell wonâ€™t sense that being. A being is alerted to being detected by this spell, as the spell produces an odd feeling of something standing right behind you or over you.
