Legilimency is the incredibly rare practice of using magic to pull information from an individual's mind. While this mysterious art often goes unnoticed, there are a select few people who have prepared themselves to resist this magic, called occlumens. 

The cerebral battle between a legilimens and an occlumens is a direct contest of discipline. An occlumens must keep their mind clear in an almost meditative state, while a legilimens must probe and test to find a weakness in those mental defenses.

If a target of the legilimens spell has the Occlumency Training feat, their training gives them the chance to make a Wisdom saving throw to immediately resist the intrusion into their mind. Additionally, that occlumens is experienced in the techniques used to throw a person out of their mind and has advantage on the Intelligence contests between them and the legilimens. 

If the target has the Skilled Occlumens school of magic feature, their mental defenses are flawless. A legilimens cannot even read their surface thoughts and the spell has no effect on them.

Those trained in occlumency have one more trick up their sleeve. If they resist the effects of the legilimens spell, they have the choice of immediately ending the spell or fabricating anything of their choosing to show to the legilimens. The legilimens has no way of detecting that the information is any different from the target's true inner thoughts. 

As a legilimens probes deeper, the occlumens can invent more and more intricate details, constructing false memories and giving misleading information.
