The Water-Freezing Charm - 1st-level Charm (ritual) 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Duration: 1 hour 

You freeze an area of water that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. Each Medium or smaller creature that is covered, submerged or partially submerged in the affected water has its speed halved and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 and the cube's size increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 1st. If a creature of any size fits within the larger cube, it can be affected by this spell.
