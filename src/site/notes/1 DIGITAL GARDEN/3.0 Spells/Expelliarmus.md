The Disarming Charm - 2nd-level Charm
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Duration: Instantaneous

Famous for being the spell that finally defeated Voldemort in the Second Wizarding War, this spell can harmlessly end duels by disarming a wizard of his wand. Make a ranged spell attack against a being within range. On a hit, you disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. The object lands 10 feet away from it in a random direction.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can choose the direction the object travels and the object's distance increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.
