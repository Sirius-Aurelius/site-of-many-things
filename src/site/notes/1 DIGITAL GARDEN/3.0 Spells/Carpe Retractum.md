The Seize and Pull Charm - Charm cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Duration: 1 round 

A bond of light shoots out from the caster and attaches to anything you can see within range, and then retracts, pulling caster and target each 10 feet closer. If the caster or target doesn't move or would easily resist the force of the other being pulled, the other moves 20 feet. If the target is an unwilling creature that is able to be moved, it must make a Strength saving throw to resist being moved. The bond of light keeps the caster and target attached for the duration. 

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the range and pulling effect both increase by 5 feet for each slot level above 0.
