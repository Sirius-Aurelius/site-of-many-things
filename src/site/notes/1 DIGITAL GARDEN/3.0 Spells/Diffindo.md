The Severing Charm - 1st-level Charm (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Duration: Instantaneous

An object is precisely torn or cut, as if a magical blade extended from the tip of your wand. This spell was not designed to be used on creatures and only makes very shallow cuts. Choose a target you can see within range that fits within a 5-foot cube. If the target is a creature, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 4d4 slashing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

This is the counterspell to incarcerous, immediately ending that spell's effects.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature or the cube's size increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 1st. If targeting additional creatures, the targets must be within 10 feet of each other when you target them.
