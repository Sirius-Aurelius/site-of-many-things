The Dangling Jinx - 4th-level Curse 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet 
Duration: 1 minute

One of the few spells that are a non-verbal spell by design, this jinx yanks a being's feet out from under it and dangles it in the air, hanging by its ankle. This spell always is cast with the effects of the Subtle Spell metamagic, at no sorcery point cost and whether you have Subtle Spell or not. 

A creature you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw or take 3d10 psychic damage and be restrained. Additionally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell is wasted
