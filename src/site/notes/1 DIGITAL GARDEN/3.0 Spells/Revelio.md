The Revealing Charm - 3rd-level Divination 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 10 feet 
Duration: Instantaneous 

With a twist of your wand, the true appearance of a creature or object is revealed. A disguised, hidden, invisible or otherwise magically concealed target is made visible, dispelling any spell producing such effects and magically removing physical alterations. 

Your wand must be pointing at the target for this spell to take effect.
