*Potion, rare* 

## Description
As an action, you can throw a bottle of Erumpent Potion at a point up to 60 feet away, releasing a violent explosion and shockwave. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

Each creature within 30 feet of that point must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

This potion is highly volatile and will explode if it is poured out of its container.
