*Potion, very rare* 

## Description

After adding the hair, nail clipping, or other part of a human, drinking this potion perfectly transforms you into that human for 1 hour, changing your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length and coloration. None of your statistics change, but your size may change to match the targeted human.

The potion works for part-humans, but not less-than-half-humans. The consistency of the potion is always like a thick mud, but the color and flavor change based on the targeted human, typically tasting very unpleasant.
