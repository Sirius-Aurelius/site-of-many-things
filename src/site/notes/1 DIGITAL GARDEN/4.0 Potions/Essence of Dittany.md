## Description

This highly concentrated liquid rapidly heals and regenerates open wounds, helping you regain 10d4+20 hit points when applied. If the target has lost appendages (fingers, legs, and so on) and the severed part is held to its place, applying Essence of Dittany causes the
limb to heal back on immediately.
