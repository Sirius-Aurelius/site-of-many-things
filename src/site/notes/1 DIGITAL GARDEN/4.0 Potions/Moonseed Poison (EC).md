*Poison, common* 

## Description

The moonseed vine, its leaves and its berries give their toxicity to this basic poison. 

A creature that ingests this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
