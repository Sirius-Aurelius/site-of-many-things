*Potion, uncommon* 

## Description

Typically administered in an emergency, this healing potion helps replenish blood lost from injuries. 

If the next rest you take is a short rest, the amount of hit points gained from rolling hit dice is doubled during that short rest. If the next rest you take is a long rest, you regain all spent hit dice.
