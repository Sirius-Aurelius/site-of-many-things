*Potion, legendary* 

## Description

Also known as "liquid luck," this potion makes you exceptionally lucky for 1d4 hours, to the point of succeeding at everything you attempt. For the duration, your Charisma score is raised to 21, you can't be surprised and have advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Additionally, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you for the duration.

This potion has been stated to greatly resemble molten gold. It is meant to be used sparingly, however, as it causes giddiness, recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence if taken in excess. Felix Felicis is highly toxic in large quantities.
