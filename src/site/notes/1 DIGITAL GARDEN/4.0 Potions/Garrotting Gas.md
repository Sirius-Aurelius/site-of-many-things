*Poison, common* (throwable)

## Description
This gas produces a choking or suffocating sensation, which, given the fact it's colorless, can be quite dangerous.

A creature that inhales this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

==As an action, you can throw a bottle of Garrotting Gas== at a point up to 60 feet away, releasing the gas and exposing creatures within 5 feet of that point.
