*Love Potion, rare* 

## Description

When a being drinks this potion, they become charmed by a chosen being and powerfully compelled to kiss them for 1 hour. The chosen being is selected by the brewer speaking their name into the potion during brewing. If the charmed subject sees the chosen being, they must use as much of their movement as possible to move to the chosen being and kiss them, ending the potion's effect.

If the brewer uses a bonus action to tell the charmed subject where the chosen being might be, the charmed subject must use as much of their movement as possible to move in that direction on their next turn. They can take their action before they move. They won't be compelled to move into an obviously deadly hazard, but they will provoke opportunity attacks.
