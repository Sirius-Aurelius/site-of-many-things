 Created by weaving [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Pellucidi Pellis\|Pellucidi Pellis]] and a few other enchantments into a silk cloak, the disillusionment cloak has no delay, functioning as an effective invisibility cloak. However, in a certain light, an onlooker may be able to see a slightly distorted outline of the cloak's shape. In combat, it's quite effective, but as with any invisibility cloak, the wearer becomes partially visible if they open it to cast a spell.
