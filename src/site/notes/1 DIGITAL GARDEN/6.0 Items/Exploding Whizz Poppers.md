## Description

These small, brightly coloured magical sweets crackle and fizz, often emitting a distinct aroma of singed sugar. When thrown, activated, or even eaten, they explode with a loud bang and a burst of harmless, but startling, magical energy, flashes of light, and colourful smoke.

One or more Exploding Whizz Poppers can be used as a single **action** on your turn. When used, choose one of the following effects:

**1. Distraction/Noise Bomb:**  
The Whizz Popper explodes with a loud bang, equivalent to a thunderclap. Creatures within 10 feet of the explosion must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check or be deafened until the end of their next turn. The explosion also creates a burst of harmless, brightly coloured smoke that lightly obscures a 5-foot radius for 1 round before dissipating.

**2. Disorient/Flashbang:**  
The Whizz Popper explodes with a burst of dazzling light and a concussive pop. Creatures within 5 feet of the explosion must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be disadvantaged on their next attack roll or ability check made before the end of their next turn.

**3. Consume:**   
If a creature eats an Exploding Whizz Popper, it explodes harmlessly in their mouth and stomach. The creature is deafened until the end of their next turn. For the next 1d4 rounds, the creature's mouth, nose, and ears will intermittently emit small, harmless puffs of brightly coloured smoke and tiny popping sounds (similar to magical fizzing fireworks). This makes stealth impossible and might cause them to accidentally belch smoke during conversation. 

The creature must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they are mildly nauseated for 1d4 rounds, causing them to have disadvantage on any saving throws made to resist the Charmed or Frightened condition during this time. On a successful save, they merely experience the deafening and smoke puffs.
