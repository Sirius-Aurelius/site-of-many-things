The Diviner's kit is a small carpet bag containing a wide range of divination equipment, including tea leaves, a tea cup and saucer, a travel tea pot, Grindylow bones, rune inscribed sticks, a deck of tarot cards and a small crystal ball. Proficiency with this kit allows you to make more accurate predictions with your Divination Abilities. Divination Abilities cannot be performed without this kit.
