## Wizarding Skills

Due to the nature of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, unique skills are needed in a wizard's daily life. Some of the traditional 5e skills are not relevant for use with this supplement and have been listed below as deprecated. 

To replace them, new wizarding skills have been added to cover the variety of subjects taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 

### Deprecated Skills

| Deprecated 5e Skill   | Equivalent New Wizarding Skill |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| INT (Arcana)          | INT (Magical Theory)           |
| INT (History)         | INT (Muggle Studies)           |
| INT (Nature)          | INT (Herbology)                |
| INT (Religion)        | INT (Potion-making)            |
| WIS (Animal Handling) | WIS (Magical Creatures)        |
>[!warning]
