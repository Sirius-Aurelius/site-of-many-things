House Points will be largely managed in the background. To avoid constant manual tracking, points are primarily generated "off-camera" based on typical student life, with opportunities for players to influence them through [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/1.0-2.0 RULES/1.0 Variant Rules/01.13 Downtime Mechanics\|Downtime]].

## Core House Point Generation ('off-camera')

House Points are gained and lost constantly at Hogwarts. This is represented "off-camera," using a **weekly average** system.

- **Weekly Baseline:** At the end of each in-game week, each House (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Slytherin) gains **10 House Points** automatically for general good conduct and academic effort from its student body. This is the baseline.
    
- **Random Fluctuation (Off-Camera):** To simulate the ebb and flow of daily school life, at the end of each week, roll **1d4 - 1d4** for each House and add the result to its weekly baseline.
    - **Result Example:** If you roll a 3 and a 1, the result is 3−1=2. So that House gains 10+2=12 points that week. If you roll a 1 and a 4, the result is 1−4=−3. So that House gains 10−3=7 points that week.
    
    - This simple roll creates minor weekly variations, reflecting other students' achievements or missteps without our needing to track them.

## Player Influence: Downtime Boosting

Players can actively contribute to their House's standing by expending their [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/1.0-2.0 RULES/1.0 Variant Rules/01.13 Downtime Mechanics\|downtime]] slots.

- **Boosting House Points:** A character can spend **2 Downtime Slots** (4 hours) to "Boost House Points."
    
    - When they do, their House immediately gains **2 House Points**.
    - This represents focused effort in classes, helpful deeds, or exemplary behavior noticed by staff.
- A character can use this action multiple times in a week, provided they have the downtime slots available. 

## DM-Triggered Point Changes (On-Camera)

The DM will, of course, also award or deduct House Points for specific player actions that happen _during_ active gameplay sessions. These are the "on-camera" moments.

- **Positive Actions:**
    - **Success in Quests/Challenges:** Completing significant tasks, solving mysteries, or achieving goals. (e.g., +5 to +20 points, depending on significance).

    - **Exceptional Roleplaying:** Demonstrating key House traits, clever problem-solving, or acts of bravery/loyalty/wit. (e.g., +1 to +5 points).
  
    - **Academic Excellence:** Particularly impressive work in lessons. (e.g., +1 to +3 points).
   
- **Negative Actions:**
    - **Breaking Rules:** Being caught out of bed, using forbidden spells, sneaking into restricted areas. (e.g., -5 to -15 points, depending on severity).
       
    - **Poor Conduct:** Disrespecting staff, fighting, blatant cheating. (e.g., -1 to -5 points).
     
    - **Failing Objectives (with consequences):** For example, if they fail to stop a major prank that disrupts school life. (e.g., -5 to -10 points).

## Managing the Score

- **Simple Tracker:** The DM will keep a tracker for all four Houses.
   
- **Announce Weekly:** At the start of a new in-game week, after resolving downtime and rolling the "off-camera" fluctuations, the DM will update on point totals.

- **Yearly Goal:** The House with the most points at the end of the school year wins the House Cup! This provides a long-term meta-game goal for the players.
