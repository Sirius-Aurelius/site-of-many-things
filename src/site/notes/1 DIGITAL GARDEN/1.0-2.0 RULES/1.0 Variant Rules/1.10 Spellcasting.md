### Magic in the Wizarding World

Magic in the Wizarding World is fluid and flexible, limited only by a wizard's knowledge and experience. Some spells depend on specific emotions, while others require mental focus and precise wand movements. Spellcasting is personal, with each witch or wizard having their own style and repertoire.

This system focuses on spellcasters, with extra attention given to how spells work. Not every spell is lethal, allowing for the ==non-lethal combat that is expected in wizarding society==. 

## Spellcasting

### Damaging Spells

Many spells inflict damage, but the effect varies greatly depending on the spell's intent. Spells can be lethal or non-lethal. Dueling spells are often non-lethal, but Dark magic can kill.

#### Non-Lethal Magic

Standard spells cannot kill, regardless of the caster's intent. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by a standard spell is knocked out non-lethally.

#### Lethal Magic

Dark spells are potentially lethal. ==A creature reduced to 0 hit points by a Dark spell dies==. It's possible to injure a creature with a Dark spell and then incapacitate it non-lethally with a non-Dark spell.

### Duration

#### Concentration

This system retains standard 5e rules for spell duration and concentration, but "dedication" spells require strategic use.

#### Dedication
>[!warning]

If a spell requires dedication, you must maintain concentration ==and use an action at the start of each turn to uphold it==. Losing dedication ends the spell.

**Factors that break dedication:**

* Casting any other spell.
* Losing line of sight to the target (for spells affecting a specific target).
* Losing concentration.

### Spell Types

#### Dark

Dark magic is used to harm, control, or kill. It includes spells, potions, and creatures. Dark magic can damage the caster's soul and often requires malicious intent. However, it's not always "evil," as Aurors may use it in dire situations.

Using Dark spells (clearly denoted in the spell name in both the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/3.1 Spells - Overview\|Spells List]] and DnD Beyond Homebrew), attracts attention and raises questions about your character's motivations. Unforgivable Curses are illegal and result in imprisonment. Casting them or killing with Dark magic may require a corruption roll.

#### Defensive

Defensive magic counters or nullifies other magic. Examples include shield charms and counter-curses.

#### School of Magic

School of magic spells are learned by joining a specific school, not by leveling up. They cannot easily be learned by students specialising in other schools of magic.

### Spell Targets

#### Being

A Being is one of the three classifications used by the Ministry of Magic to categorize magical creatures. Beings have sufficient intelligence to understand and participate in shaping the laws of the magical community.

Examples include humans, goblins, vampires, hags, giants, house-elves, veela, werewolves, merpeople, and centaurs.

#### Beast

A Beast is any living thing that doesn't meet the criteria of a Being. This includes most animals and creatures encountered in Care of Magical Creatures.

Some creatures, like Acromantulas and Sphinxes, might seem intelligent enough to be Beings, but their violent tendencies disqualify them.

#### Object

An object is an inanimate item. Movement, speech, or other signs of life might be due to enchantments, not true sentience.

#### Spirit

The Spirit classification was created for ghosts who felt the term "being" was inappropriate for them. This highlights the divide between the living and the dead in the wizarding world.
