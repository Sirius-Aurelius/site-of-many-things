Transfiguration is a branch of magic that focuses on the alteration of the form or appearance of an object, via the manipulation of the object's molecular structure. Transfiguration is regarded as “very hard work” and is “more scientific” than any other form of magic, i.e. the practicing witch or wizard has to get it exactly right for the transfiguration to be successful.

### Animagi

The most legendary practitioner of transfiguration is an Animagus, a witch or wizard who can self-transfigure into an animal at will. It takes skill, practice, and patience for wizards and witches to become Animagi. The process is long and arduous, and has the potential to backfire and cause the transformation to go horribly wrong. As a result, there are very few Animagi, and the power they possess requires registration with the Ministry of Magic.

### Alchemists

A far less known application of transfiguration is Alchemy, the branch of magic and an ancient science concerned with the study of the structure, composition, and magical properties of the four basic elements (earth, air, fire, and water), as well as the transmutation of substances. Intimately connected with potion-making, chemistry and transfiguration, there are many who hold it to be the most difficult magic.

## Subclass Features

### Scientific Studies

At 1st level, you gain one of the following features.

* **Anatomy Textbook.** Your knowledge of the inner workings of a creature make your transfigurations easier. If a Transfiguration spell must be cast at a higher level to involve a living creature, you can involve a living creature and consume a spell slot one level lower than what's required.
* **Intuitive Conversion.** Conceptualizing a transfiguration just comes easily to you. When you cast vera verto, it automatically affects targets one size larger than specified by the spell slot level.

### Transfiguration Prodigy

At 6th level, you gain one of the following features.

* **Animagus Transformation.** You can use your action to magically assume the shape of your animagus form (see [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/1.0-2.0 RULES/1.0 Variant Rules/1.5.4 Schools of Magic - Transfiguration#Your Animagus Form\|Your Animagus Form]] below). You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
* **Elementalist.** Your study of Alchemy has given you insights in the nature of elements. Any spell that involves only fire, water, earth, or air is automatically cast one level higher than the consumed spell slot, not exceeding the highest available level of spell slots you have.

### Precise Control

At 10th level, you gain one of the following features.

* **Partial Transfiguration.** Your understanding of magical theory has enabled you to compartmentalize your magic. Any transfiguration spell can be intentionally cast as a partial transfiguration, converting only the desired portion of the target. All the same capabilities and restrictions of casting those spells at higher levels apply.
* **Molding the Elements.** You've learned to bend the elements to your will. Any spell that involves only fire, water, earth, or air can be cast in a different shape than the original spell intended. The new shape cannot exceed the approximate area or volume of the original spell.

### Magically Reinforced

At 14th level, you gain one of the following features.

* **Durable Constructs.** You imbue your constructs of creatures with a more potent magic. Your transfigured or conjured living constructs gain additional hit points equal to your level and deal an additional 1d6 of damage.
* **Fortified Structures.** You've learned to make magical objects stronger than the real thing. Your transfigured or conjured objects have twice as many hit points before breaking, and can support three times as much weight as their mundane equivalents.

### Molecular Manipulator

At 18th level, you gain one of the following features.

* **Apex Predator.** Animagus Transformation required. You've achieved complete mastery over the mystical art of animagus transformations. You can transform on your turn as a bonus action, instead of an action. Additionally, you can select two additional creatures as your animagus shapes, and you can choose to keep these shapes hidden from the Ministry of Magic. You may also choose to use any of these animals as your corporeal patronus.
* **True Alchemist.** Your lifelong study of Flamel's and Dumbledore's writings has finally come to fruition. You can create a Philosopher’s Stone, turning any metal into gold and producing the Elixir of Life. You cannot die of natural causes, and you age at a slower rate. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. Only one Philosopher’s Stone may exist at one time.

## Your Animagus Form

You can stay in animagus form for a number of hours equal to half your transfiguration level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you, use the higher bonus.
* When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and hit dice. When you revert, you return to the hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animagus form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage.
* You can't cast spells, and the actions you can take are dependent on your beast form's physical capabilities. Transforming doesn't break your concentration or prevent actions that are part of an already-cast spell, but Dedication spells end upon transforming.
* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.
* Your equipment merges into your new form and has no effect until you leave the form.

When you gain the Animagus Transformation feature, you must decide between the two types of forms: Combat form or Evasion form. This is a permanent, one-time choice and will determine the stats and abilities of your animagus form. 

### Combat Form 
A Combat animagus form is a large or powerful predator that can hold its own against dangerous creatures. It is both sturdy and capable of fighting back with lethal force. 

Your form must be classified into one of two categories: Land or Water. If your chosen animal breathes and lives underwater, it must be Water. Otherwise, it will be Land; an air-breathing animal that lives on land and is incapable of flight. This classification will determine certain statistics and traits of your animagus form's stat block. 

Combat forms can be one of two sizes: Medium or Large. Your form's size should be determined by the creature's actual size; for instance, all dogs would be Medium, not Large. 

You need your DM's approval to choose a Large-sized animagus form, and transforming into a Large animal may mean you'll be unable to transform in cramped spaces.

### Evasion Form 
An Evasion animagus form is a small and discreet animal that would not typically attract a lot of attention. It is likely prey in the natural word, surviving by being quiet, mobile and alert. Evasion forms are largely useless in combat, but can hide, escape and get to hard-to-reach places. 

Your form must be classified into one of three categories: Land, Water or Air. If your chosen animal breathes and lives underwater, it must be Water. If it is an air-breathing animal that lives on land and is incapable of flight, it must be Land. If it is capable of sustained flight, it must be Air. This classification will determine certain statistics and traits of your animagus form's stat block. 

Evasion forms can be one of three sizes: Tiny, Small or Medium. Your form's size should be determined by the creature's actual size; for instance, a cat would be Tiny and a hawk would be Small.

### Choosing an Animal 
Your animagus form is the same animal as your corporeal patronus (see [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Expecto Patronum\|Expecto Patronum]]). 

Choose your animagus form from the animals listed in the  [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Expecto Patronum - Rolling Table\|Expecto Patronum - Rolling Table]]. You should choose a patronus based on your desired animagus attributes (Combat vs. Evasion, Land vs. Water vs. Air). 

Your animagus form cannot be a magical beast. If you roll a magical beast (91-00 or 0) while determining your corporeal patronus, you must re-roll your patronus animal.
