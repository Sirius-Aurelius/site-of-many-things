When you score a critical hit with a spell that does not deal damage, the spell is automatically cast one level higher than the consumed spell slot, not exceeding the highest available level of spell slots you have. 

If the spellâ€™s language does not allow it to be cast one level higher, the target makes their next saving throw against the effects of that spell (if applicable) at disadvantage.
