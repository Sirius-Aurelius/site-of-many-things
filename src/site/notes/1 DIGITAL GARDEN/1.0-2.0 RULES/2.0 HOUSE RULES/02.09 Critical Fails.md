When a target of a spell rolls a 1 on their first saving throw, that spell is treated as if it scored a critical hit. This can be combined with the [[1 DIGITAL GARDEN/1.0-2.0 RULES/2.0 HOUSE RULES/02.08 Critical Hits\|variant rule for critical hits]], and those rules apply when a target critically fails on their saving throw against a spell that does not deal damage.
