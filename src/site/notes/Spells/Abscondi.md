The Track Obliteration Charm - 2nd-level Charm (ritual) 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour 

A magical aura makes your impact on your surroundings unseen, masking you and your companions from detection.

A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.
