The Swarming Jinx - 2nd-level Curse 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You cast this jinx on a group of tiny objects or a group of birds within range. The targets start swarming in the air in a 5-footdiameter sphere in an unoccupied space of your choice. Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the swarm or enters the swarmâ€™s area for the first time on a turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 4d4 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. While the swarm shares the same space with a creature, that creature has disadvantage on attack rolls. The swarm's space counts as difficult terrain. 

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.
