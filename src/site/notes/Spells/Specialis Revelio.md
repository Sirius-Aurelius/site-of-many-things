The Spell Revealing Spell - 1st-level Divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Duration: Instantaneous

You tap your wand on an object or area, revealing magical influences. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.

If cast on an area, you learn what spells, if any, are currently active within a 5-foot cube in front of you. The border of each spell's effect is illuminated within that cube, much like blowing dust through laser beams.
