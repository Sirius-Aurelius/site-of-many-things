The Shield Charm - 1st-level Charm 
Casting Time: 1 action or reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack 
Range: Self 
Duration: ==Dedication==, up to 10 minutes 

An invisible barrier of magical force appears in front of you and protects you. For the duration, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack. If you are targeted by a spell that requires an attack roll and the spell's level is equal to or lower than half your proficiency bonus, the spell has no effect on you. 

You can use a bonus action to change which direction the shield is facing. 

If you are attacked from either of your sides or from behind while casting this spell, you must use your reaction to redirect the shield to point towards the threat. Otherwise, this spell doesn't protect you.
