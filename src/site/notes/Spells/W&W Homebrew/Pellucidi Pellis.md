The Disillusionment Charm - 2nd-level Charm 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Touch 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour 

With a tap of a wand on the top of the head and a sensation of raw egg being broken where the wand was tapped, a creature becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the targetâ€™s person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell. 

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. The targets must be within 5 feet of each other when you target them.
