The Reverse Spell - Divination cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self 
Duration: Instantaneous 

Often used as an investigative tool in wizarding crimes, this spell produces a ghostly recreation of the previous spell cast by the currently used wand. If the previously cast spell cannot be represented visually, you learn the incantation that was used, regardless of whether the incantation was spoken aloud at the time of casting. This spell can be cast a total of three consecutive times on a single wand, revealing the three most recently cast spells.
