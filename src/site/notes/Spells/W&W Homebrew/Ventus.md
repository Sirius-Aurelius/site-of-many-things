The Cyclone Jinx - 2nd-level Curse (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A strong gust of air flows out from the tip of your wand, and creates one of the following effects at a point you can see within range:

- One Medium or smaller creature that you choose must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be instantaneously pushed up to 5 feet away from you and be rendered unable to move closer to you for the duration.
- You create a small blast of air capable of moving one object that is neither held nor carried and that weighs no more than 5 pounds. The object is pushed up to 10 feet away from you per round, for the duration of the spell. It isnâ€™t pushed with enough force to cause damage.
- You create a harmless sensory effect using air, such as causing leaves to rustle, wind to slam shutters shut, or your clothing to ripple in a breeze. If desired, the air can be hot and function like a blow dryer.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
