The Bone Mending Spell - 4th-level Healing 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Touch 
Duration: Instantaneous 

This spell heals a being's broken bones immediately, although the process is quite painful. A being you can see that you tap with your wand regains a number of hit points equal to 5d10 + your spellcasting ability modifier, and gains a level of exhaustion. 

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.
