The Bluebell Flames Spell - Transfiguration cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 1 hour 

A flickering blue flame flows out from the tip of your wand, condensing on an object, in a container, or in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and only emanates heat directly upwards. It doesn't harm anything beneath or around it, and seems to hover slightly above whatever it's resting upon. If placed beneath a flammable object, a natural fire may be started from the heat. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as a bonus action.
