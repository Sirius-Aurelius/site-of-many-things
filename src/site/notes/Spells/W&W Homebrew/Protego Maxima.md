The Orb Shield Charm - 2nd-level Charm 
Casting Time: 1 action or reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack 
Range: Self 
Duration: ==Dedication==, up to 10 minutes 

You cast a fully encompassing [[Spells/W&W Homebrew/Protego\|Protego]] around yourself, sacrificing durability for coverage. For the duration, you have a +3 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack. 

If you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail.
