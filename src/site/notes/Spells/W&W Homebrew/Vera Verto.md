The General Transfiguration Incantation - Transfiguration cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Duration: Until dispelled

This universal incantation is taught to Hogwarts students in their first Transfiguration class. You transfigure one nonmagical object that you can see within range and that fits within a 1-foot cube into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you may select or stack one of the following effects for each slot level above 0.

- Increase the cube size by 2 feet.
- Target a living Beast (if unwilling, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect).
- Transfigure into a construct (Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute).
