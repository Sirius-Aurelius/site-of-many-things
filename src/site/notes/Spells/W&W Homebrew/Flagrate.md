 Casting Time: 1 action 
 Range: Touch 
 Duration: Until dispelled 
 
 You trace your wand in the air or over an object, leaving fiery marks in that position. You may write any letters or depict any shapes, as if you were writing with a quill. Although the glowing letters appear to be made of fire, it is just an illusion and it cannot burn anything.
