The Stunning Spell - 2nd-level Charm
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Duration: 10 minutes

This charm is the most common dueling spell in the wizarding world, harmlessly ending a duel between two wizards. 

Make a ranged spell attack against a being within range. On a hit, the target falls unconscious for the duration, or until they are revived with [[Spells/W&W Homebrew/Rennervate\|Rennervate]].

**At Higher Levels**. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration increases to 1 hour (3rd level) or 8 hours (4th level). Alternatively, when you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target a beast instead of a being, for a duration of 10 minutes (4th level), 1 hour (5th level) or 8 hours (6th level).
