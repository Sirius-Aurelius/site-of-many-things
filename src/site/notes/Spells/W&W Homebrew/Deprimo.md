The Crushing Charm - 3rd-level Charm (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Duration: Instantaneous

You place immense downward pressure on a target you can see within range. If the target is a creature, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t knocked prone. If the target is a flat surface, this will either create a crater or collapse the surface.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage is increased by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
