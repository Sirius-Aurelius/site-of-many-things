The Firestorm Spell - 6th-level Transfiguration 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You create a ringed wall of fire within range up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 10 feet thick choosing whether it's touching the ground or in the air. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration. When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

As an action, you can send a tendril of flames lashing out at any point within 60 feet of the center of the ring. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of the wall and fiery burst is affected only once. The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that arenâ€™t being worn or carried. 

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 and the ring's radius increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 6th.
