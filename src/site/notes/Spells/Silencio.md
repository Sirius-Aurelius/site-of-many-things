The Silencing Charm - 2nd-level Charm (ritual) 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 90 feet 
Duration: 1 minute 

This charm is extremely effective against wizards unpracticed in non-verbal magic. Choose one target that you can see within range. If it's a creature, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails or if it's an object, all sound created by the target is made completely silent. 

Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible while under the effect of this spell.
