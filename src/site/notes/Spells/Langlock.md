The Gagging Jinx - 3rd-level Curse 
Casting Time: 1 action or reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell 
Range: 60 feet 
Duration: 1 round 

You attempt to interrupt a being you can see in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is verbally casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is verbally casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell fails and has no effect. 

On a success or if the being was casting the spell nonverbally, the target must cast all other spells non-verbally until the end of its next turn. If it tries to cast a spell verbally, it must first succeed on an Intelligence saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell is wasted. 

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used
