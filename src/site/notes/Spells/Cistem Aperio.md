The Container Opening Charm - Charm cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Duration: Instantaneous 

Choose a box, chest, or another container that you can see within range that uses mundane or magical means to prevent access. A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or chained becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unchained. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked. If you choose a target that is held shut with Colloportus, that spell is dispelled. When you cast the spell, the mechanism noisily turns and unlocks. This noise emanates from the target object and is audible from as far away as 100 feet
