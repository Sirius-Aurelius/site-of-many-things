Players may declare *any* value *up to* their rolled initiative order (including bonus) but they may only do this at the time initiative is rolled (i.e. before the first round commences).

If no alternative result is explicitly declared initiative will be as rolled.

If a player exercises this option, their nominated initiative order then remains in place for the rest of the encounter.
