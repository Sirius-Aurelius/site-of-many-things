Players can 'win' advantage on checks or attacks if they're willing to undertake high-action moves. 

For example, a Fighter might leap up and swing from a chandelier to stab at a foe down below. 

Or a Spellcaster might try to target adjacent scenery or attempt to bounce a spell of a reflective surface.

The DM may call for a relevant ability check, *granting advantage on the attack with a successful check*. On a failed check, the character's move goes awry, as normal. 

I use 'scaled checks', so if you failed by a little you'd still get an attack; just a narratively less glorious one. If you fail by more, then the manoeuvre fails completely (the attack automisses)

From Lazy GM:
>*Most characters will focus on moves that use ability checks they're good at, making success more likely than failure. A slight chance of failure can make winning advantage feel that much sweeter, but keep failure conditions fairly minor so that going for cinematic advantage doesn't seem too risky to the players.*
