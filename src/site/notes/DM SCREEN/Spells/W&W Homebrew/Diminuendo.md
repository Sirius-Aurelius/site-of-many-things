The Diminishing Charm - 2nd-level Charm
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Make a ranged spell attack against a creature within range.

On a hit, the being or beast's size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category - from Medium to Small, for example.

Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's items or equipment also shrink to match its new size, but any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once. The target deals 1d4 less damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1).
