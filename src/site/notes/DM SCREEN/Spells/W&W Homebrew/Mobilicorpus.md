The Carrying Charm - 1st-level Charm (ritual) 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet 
Duration: 1 hour 

One willing, paralyzed, petrified, restrained, stunned or unconscious being of your choice that you can see within range rises 3 feet off the ground, and remains suspended there for the duration as if it were hoisted by invisible ropes under its arms. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. If more weight than the limit is placed on top of the being, the spell ends, and it falls to the ground. 

The being is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the being follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can't cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the being can't move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom. If you move more than 100 feet from the being (typically because it can't move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.
