The Imperius Curse - 5th-level Curse 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 10 feet 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 

When this Unforgivable Curse is cast, an incredibly wonderful, floating feeling comes over the victim, granting them a feeling of "untraceable happiness" and peace. In this state, the person's will is completely overridden by the caster and they will follow any command. A being of your choice within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw at disadvantage or be charmed by you for the duration. 

While the target is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well. Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Charisma saving throw at disadvantage against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends. 

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a higher level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes (6th level), up to 1 hour (7th level), up to 8 hours (8th level), or until dispelled with no concentration (9th level).
