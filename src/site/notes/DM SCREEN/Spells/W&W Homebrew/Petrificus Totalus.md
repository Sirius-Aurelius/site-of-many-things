The Full Body-Bind Curse - 1st-level Curse 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Duration: Dedication, up to 1 minute 

This spell makes a being's arms and legs snap together, and it will fall down, stiff as a board. Make a ranged spell attack against a being within range. On a hit, the target is knocked prone and paralyzed for the duration. 

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target a beast instead of a being.
