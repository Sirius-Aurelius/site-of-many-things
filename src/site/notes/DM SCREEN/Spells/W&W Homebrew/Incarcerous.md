The Binding Spell - 2nd-level Transfiguration (ritual) 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet 
Duration: 24 hours 

Black cords and ropes are conjured and wrap themselves forcefully around a target you can see within range. If the target is an unwilling creature, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained for the duration. Upon casting, you can choose to anchor the ropes to the ground, preventing the target from being moved by external forces.

The restrained creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained effect ends. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the creature is also incapacitated, rendering it unable make a Strength check to escape.
