The Slug-Vomiting Hex - 2nd-level Curse
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Duration: 1 round

This particularly nasty hex causes one to spit up slugs for the duration. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature within range. On a hit, it takes 3d8 psychic damage and gains one level of exhaustion. This spell cannot cause it to reachmore than 5 levels of exhaustion. 

If it tries to cast a spell verbally before the end of its next turn, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell is wasted.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
