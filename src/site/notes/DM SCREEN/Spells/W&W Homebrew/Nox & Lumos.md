The Wand-Lighting Charm - Charm cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action (for Lumos). 1 bonus action (for Nox)
Range: Self 
Duration: Until dispelled 

[[DM SCREEN/Spells/W&W Homebrew/Lumos & Nox\|LUMOS]]: Upon muttering the incantation, the tip of your wand sheds bright light in a narrow 15-foot cone and dim light for an additional 15 feet, much like a flashlight. The light is a bright white with a slight bluish tint. Completely covering the tip of your wand with something opaque blocks the light. 

NOX: The spell ends if you dismiss it with the Nox incantation, as a bonus action.
