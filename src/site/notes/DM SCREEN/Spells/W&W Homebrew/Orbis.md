The Rooting Spell - 2nd-level Transfiguration 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You choose a space on the ground that is currently occupied by a Large or smaller creature you can see within range. The ground becomes a thick liquid and swirls out from under the creature in an orb-like shape. The material then slams back down and regains its solidity in an attempt to partially bury the creature. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained for the spellâ€™s duration.

As an action, you can cause the earth to crush the restrained target, who must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. To break out, the restrained target can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target pulls its legs free and is no longer restrained. 

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
