The Banishing Charm - 3rd-level Charm
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Duration: Instantaneous

A target within range is pushed directly away from the caster as if shoved by an invisible hand, being thrown 5 feet away plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The target is selected by the caster pointing at it with their wand.

If targeting a creature or object that is being worn or carried, make a check with 26 Strength (+8) contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target creature. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the target is thrown the same distance.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the shove distance is increased by 10 feet for each slot level above 3rd.
