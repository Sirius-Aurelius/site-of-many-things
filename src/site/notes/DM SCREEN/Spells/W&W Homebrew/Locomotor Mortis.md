The Leg-Locker Curse - 1st-level Curse
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 90 feet 
Duration: 1 minute 

A common tool among bullies, this "curse" binds a creature's legs as if they were tied together with rope. A creature you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have its speed halved and suffer disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws. 

Additionally, each time it moves within the duration, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw without disadvantage from this spell, or be knocked prone and take 2d4 bludgeoning damage.
