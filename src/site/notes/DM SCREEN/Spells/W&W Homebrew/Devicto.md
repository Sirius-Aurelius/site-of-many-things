The Stinging Jinx - Curse cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Duration: Instantaneous

This weak jinx is a classic training spell between duelists, a startling sting on impact. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature within range. On a hit, it takes 1d6 force damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
