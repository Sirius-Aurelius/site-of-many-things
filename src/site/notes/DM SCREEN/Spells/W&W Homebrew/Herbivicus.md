 The Gardening Charm - 3rd-level Charm 
 Casting Time: 1 action or 1 minute 
 Range: 90 feet 
 Duration: 1 hour or Instantaneous 
 
 This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits. If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All non-magical plants in a 60-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown for 1 hour, turning the area into difficult terrain. These plants can't be used in potions, due to being magically manipulated. If you cast this spell over 1 minute, you accelerate the growth of a single young plant you can see within range, magical or mundane. The plant instantly reaches maturity, but does not exceed a healthy "adult" size.
