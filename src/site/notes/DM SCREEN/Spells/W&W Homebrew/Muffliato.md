The Anti-Eavesdropping Charm - 2nd-level Charm 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour 

For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) are able to converse with each other without anyone or anything else hearing. Instead of the voices, nearby creatures hear a faint buzzing, like white noise. If a creature is within 15 feet of you and sees your mouth move when you speak, it is aware that your voice is being magically masked.
