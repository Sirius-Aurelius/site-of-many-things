The Shrinking Charm - 1st-level Charm (ritual) 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet 
Duration: 1 hour 

You cause an object that isn't being worn or carried and that you can see within range to shrink in size for the duration. The target’s size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. 

This reduction decreases its size by one category – from Medium to Small, for example.
