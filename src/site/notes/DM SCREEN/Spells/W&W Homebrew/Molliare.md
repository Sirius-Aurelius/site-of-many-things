The Cushioning Charm - Charm Cantrip 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 1 hour 

This comfortable charm is most commonly found on a broomstick. One object you touch with your wand is wrapped in an invisible cushioning effect for the duration, almost like two magnets repelling one another.
