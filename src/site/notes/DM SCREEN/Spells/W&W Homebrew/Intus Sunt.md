The Entrail-Expelling Curse - 3rd-level Healing (ritual) 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 

Invented by Urquhart Rackharrow, this medieval remedy causes the recipient to purge and experience great abdominal pain. Choose one being that you can see within range to make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the target's exhaustion is set to 2 levels for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw, without disadvantage from exhaustion. On a success, the spell ends. 

If the target has higher levels of exhaustion than the spell's effect, the spell does not change its levels of exhaustion. If the target gains any levels of exhaustion within the duration of this spell, it stacks with this spell's effect. Additionally, if the target is suffering any condition or negative effects from something it ingested, such as drinking a poison, this spell ends those effects. 

**At Higher Levels**. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the target's exhaustion is set to 3 levels (6th level), 4 levels (7th level), or 5 levels (8th level).
