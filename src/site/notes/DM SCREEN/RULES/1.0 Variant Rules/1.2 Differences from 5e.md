# Welcome to the Wizarding World!
This campaign uses all the core mechanics and rules of D&D (5e 2014), but is adapted using *Wands & Wizards*, a published homebrew add-on system, which I have then *re*adapted to enable character creation and management in DnD Beyond. 

# Differences to 5e
All DnD spells, magic items and feats are replaced by Wizarding World alternatives (DnDBeyond home-brewed). 

Perhaps the most significant differences from 5e come during character creation, which is (for obvious reasons of faithfulness to the WW universe) greatly restricted vs 5e (see [[DM SCREEN/RULES/1.0 Variant Rules/1.2 Differences from 5e#Character Creation Conversion Table\|table below]])

These notes, and the associated Site of Many Things (where you are most likely reading this) attempt to collate and publish these variant and house rules for players ahead of Session Zero.
