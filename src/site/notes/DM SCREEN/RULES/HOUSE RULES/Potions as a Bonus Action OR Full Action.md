Potions can be consumed at the cost of one **bonus** action. If doing so for a healing potion (or any other potion requiring a dice roll), the player rolls for the effect as normal.

Alternatively, players can spend a **full** action to consume a potion. In this case they receive the maximum possible benefit from that potion if a roll would usually be required.
