As all students at Hogwarts are innately magical, the 'class' selection in DnDBeyond is restricted to Sorcerer only (at least until you sit your O.W.L.s, after which multiclassing may be introduced). This means that ==for all players, wisdom will be your spellcasting ability== and you will get to choose metamagic options at level three.

As all DnD 5e spells are redundant you will not need to select anything from the sorcerer spells list in DND Beyond. Instead you will learn spells throughout your time at Hogwarts (in a way not dissimilar to Wizards in 5e).

All players in this campaign should select the Sorceror 'class' in D&D Beyond.
