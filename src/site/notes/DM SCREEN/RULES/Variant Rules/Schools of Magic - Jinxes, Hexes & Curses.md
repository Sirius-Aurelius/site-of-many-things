Formally referred to as Dark charms, jinxes, hexes and curses are often associated with the Dark Arts because they inflict malicious effects on the target. While jinxes are mostly irritating and hexes are a little worse or more painful, curses are the worst kind of Dark magic. All three Unforgivables are classified as curses, and the average civilian wizard could go their whole life without casting a serious curse.

### Aurors

Curses are mainstays in the arsenals of Aurors, highly-trained specialist officers tasked with upholding the law and protecting their magical communities from large-scale threats. To be successful, an Auror must be capable across a variety of skills, like curses, counter-spells, transfiguration, poisons, antidotes, concealment, disguise, and tracking.

### Curse-Breakers

On the other end of the spectrum, a curse-breaker removes, counters or breaks curses placed on objects or places for a living. Whilst curse-breakers could work for the Ministry of Magic, the term is also used to denote a number of adventurous bankers employed by Gringotts Wizarding Bank, tasked with disabling and countering curses in ancient tombs or historical sites to bring back gold and treasure.
