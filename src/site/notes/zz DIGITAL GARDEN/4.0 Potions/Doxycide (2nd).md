*Poison, common* 

## Description

Delivered as a mist via a spray bottle, this mild potion is a household staple to deal with pests. 

A creature that inhales this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 2 (1d4) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

If the victim of this poison is a tiny Beast, it is paralyzed for 1 hour on a failed save.
