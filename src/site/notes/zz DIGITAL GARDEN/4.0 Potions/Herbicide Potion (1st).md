*Potion, common 

## Description

When this poison is poured directly on a magical plant, the plant immediately withers and dies. There is only enough poison to affect a plant that fits within a 5 foot cube. 

If the magical plant is larger than a 5 foot cube, the affected area will wither, but the plant will not die until the entire plant is withered.
