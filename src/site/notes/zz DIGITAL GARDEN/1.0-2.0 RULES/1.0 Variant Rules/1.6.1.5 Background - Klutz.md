# Klutz

Maybe you're an incredibly uncoordinated person, or perhaps you inherited a particularly petty curse. Whatever the cause, you continually find yourself in the middle of mishaps and blunders. Since being accident-prone is a very dangerous thing to be in the wizarding world, you tend to be hypervigilant and wary of your surroundings.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Medicine, Perception
**Equipment:** A lucky charm, and a package of plasters

### Background Feature: Walking Disaster

You've seen so many situations go completely awry that you've started being able to predict all the ways things can go wrong. If you're looking to hinder something or bring about a dangerous accident, you'll have no shortage of ideas.

### **d6 Wood (Personality Traits)**

| d6  | Wood     |
| --- | -------- |
| 1-2 | Ash      |
| 3-4 | Cypress  |
| 5-6 | Willow   |

**Ash**

The ash wand clings to its one true master and ought not to be passed on or gifted from the original owner, because it will lose power and skill. Witches and wizards best suited to ash wands are not lightly swayed from their beliefs or purposes. However, a brash or over-confident witch or wizard will be disappointed by its effects. The ideal owner may be stubborn, and will certainly be courageous, but never crass or arrogant.

**Cypress**

Cypress wands are associated with nobility and dying a heroic death, historically. Fortunately, the possessors of cypress wands are rarely called upon to lay down their lives, but doubtless many of them would do so if required. Wands of cypress find their soulmates among the brave, the bold and the self-sacrificing: those who are unafraid to confront the shadows in their own and others’ natures.

**Willow**

Willow is an uncommon wand wood with healing power, and their ideal owner often has some (usually unwarranted) insecurity, however well they may try and hide it. With a handsome appearance and well-founded reputation for enabling advanced, non-verbal magic, the willow wands have consistently selected those of greatest potential, rather than those who feel they have little to learn.

### **d6 Core (Ideal)**

| d6  | Core (Ideal)                                                                |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2 | Unicorn Hair: Greater Good. The most noble cause is to lay down our lives to defend others. |
| 3-4 | Dragon Heartstring: Respect. All people—rich or poor, powerful or weak, magical or muggle—deserve respect. |
| 5-6 | Phoenix Feather: Sincerity. There's no good pretending to be something I'm not. |
### **d6 Length (Bond)**

| d6  | Length (Bond)                                                                                                    |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2 | 9": Someone is depending on me, and I'll never forgive myself if I let them down.                               |
| 3-4 | 12.5": I have to prove to that I'm not a disappointment to my family, mentors or peers.                                            |
| 5-6 | 14": I will be fiercely loyal to anyone who doesn't see me for my faults, but for who I am.                                        |
### **d6 Flexibility (Flaw)**

| d6  | Flexibility (Flaw)                                                                  |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2 | Inflexible: I am slow to trust that others' words are sincere, because of some bad experiences. |
| 3-4 | Slightly Pliant: I follow the rules, even if they aren't what's best.                       |
| 5-6 | Very Supple: I'm always putting my foot in my mouth, invariably insulting or embarrassing others. |
## Variant Feature: Punching Bag

You may not be coordinated, but at least you've learned how to take a punch. You have resistance to damage dealt by falling, traps or inanimate objects. You also have disadvantage on saving throws made to avoid or resist traps, any rolls made to detect traps and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.
