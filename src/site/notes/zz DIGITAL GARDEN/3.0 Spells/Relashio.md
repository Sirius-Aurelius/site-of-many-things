The Revulsion Jinx - 2nd-Level Curse 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Duration: Instantaneous 

This spell forces both living and inanimate targets to release their grip. Choose an object or creature that you can see within range. The object can be a set of manacles, a padlock, chains, or another object that is wrapped around or restraining something. 

If the target is a creature, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it must let go of whatever it is restraining. This effect ends any grappled or restrained condition that is being imposed by the target. 

An object that is secured by a mundane or magical lock or that is stuck becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. When you cast the spell on an object, a loud rattling or clanking, audible from as far away as 100 feet, emanates from the target object. 

A creature is not forced to drop any object that it is holding. The creature must be restraining the object in some way, like holding onto an object that has had [[zz DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Accio\|Accio]] cast upon it.
