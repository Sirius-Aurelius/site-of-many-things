The Tickling Charm - 1st-level Charm 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Duration: 1 round 

This low-level dueling spell gives the recipient an intense tickling sensation. Make a ranged spell attack against a being within range. On a hit, the target will double over in laughter and become incapacitated with its speed halved until the start of your next turn.
