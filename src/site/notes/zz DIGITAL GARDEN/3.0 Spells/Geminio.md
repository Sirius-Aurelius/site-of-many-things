The Doubling Charm - 2nd-level Charm (ritual) 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 10 days 

You tap an object that fits within a 1-foot cube with your wand and a perfect duplicate of it pops out from the object. The duplicate is indistinguishable from the object by normal means, but does not share any of its magical qualities or functions. The duplicate has one quarter of the original object's hit points and vanishes at the end of the spell's duration. 

To detect the duplicate's inauthenticity, a creature within 5 feet of it can use an action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. On a success, it perceives subtle flaws and understands it to be a fake. 5 days after casting this spell, the duplicate begins to show significant signs of degradation, granting advantage on the Investigation check. 

If [[zz DIGITAL GARDEN/3.0 Spells/Specialis Revelio\|Specialis Revelio]] is cast on the duplicate, the caster is made aware that the object is a duplicate created by this spell. 

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the cube's size increases by 1 foot for each slot level above 2nd.
