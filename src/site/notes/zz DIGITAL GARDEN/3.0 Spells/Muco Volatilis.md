The Bat-Bogey Hex - 4th-level Curse 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 

This terrifying spell transforms the victim's bogies (or boogers) into nasty green bats that crawl out of their nose and attack. Make a ranged spell attack against a being within range. On a hit, the target and any hostile creatures within 5 feet of the target take 6d4 slashing damage. 

At the start of the target's turn and when any hostile creature starts its turn within 5 feet of the target, it takes 3d4 slashing damage. If any creature has to make a saving throw to maintain concentration because of this spell's damage, the saving throw is made at disadvantage. 

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 4th.
