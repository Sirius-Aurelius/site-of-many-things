The Fire-Making Spell - 1st-level Transfiguration (ritual) 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 90 feet 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You create a bonfire on ground that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the bonfire fills a 5-foot cube. Any creature in the bonfire’s space when you cast the spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the bonfire’s space for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. 

The bonfire ignites flammable objects in its area that aren’t being worn or carried. If there is adequate fuel for the bonfire to burn, it will continue burning after the spell ends. 

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
