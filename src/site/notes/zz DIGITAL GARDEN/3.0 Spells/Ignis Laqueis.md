The Fire Whip Spell - 3rd-level Transfiguration 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Duration: **Dedication**, up to 1 minute 

You create a long, snaking whip of fire from the tip of your wand, lashing out and coiling around a creature in range. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the creature takes 4d10 fire damage and is grappled for the duration. As an action, the target can make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw to end the spell's effects. On each of your following turns spent maintaining dedication, the whip tightens and you deal 4d10 fire damage to the target automatically. If the creature is Large or smaller, you can use a bonus action to pull the creature up to 10 feet closer to you. 

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial damage and subsequent turn damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.
