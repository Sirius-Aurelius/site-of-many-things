The Mending Charm - 2nd-level Charm (ritual) 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet 
Duration: Instantaneous 

This spell magically reverses any damage done to any objects or structures within a 5-foot cube, collecting all the pieces or components and reassembling them. 

Anything previously contained by the broken target, like a spilled liquid, is not placed back inside it. Anything affected by the breaking of the target, like a person who fell through a broken platform, is not undone. 

There is no effect on anything within the area that's undamaged, nor on anything damaged by time or decay.

This spell can physically repair a magic item, but the spell canâ€™t restore magic to such an object. 

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the cube's size increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.
