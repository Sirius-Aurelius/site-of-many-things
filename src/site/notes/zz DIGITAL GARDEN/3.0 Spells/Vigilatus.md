The Intruder Charm - 1st-level Charm (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 30 feet
Duration: 8 hours

You set a mental alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, a ping in your mind alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area, if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.

When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm.
