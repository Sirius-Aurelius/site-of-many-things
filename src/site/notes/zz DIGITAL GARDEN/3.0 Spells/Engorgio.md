The Engorgement Charm - 2nd-level Charm (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 minute

You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that isnâ€™t being worn or carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.

The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category - from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's items and equipment also grow to match its new size. While enlarged, the target deals 1d4 extra damage.
