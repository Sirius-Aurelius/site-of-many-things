The Knockback Jinx - 1st-level Curse 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Duration: Instantaneous 

The spell feels like a very heavy blow, sharply throwing a creature from its standing position to the ground. Choose a being you can see within range to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage, is knocked back a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier, and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, is knocked back 5 feet, and isnâ€™t knocked prone.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 and the knockback on a failed save increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 1st.
