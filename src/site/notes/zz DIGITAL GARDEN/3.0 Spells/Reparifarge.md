The Untransfiguration Incantation - 2nd-level Transfiguration 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 90 feet 
Duration: Instantaneous 

Choose any creature, object, or magical effect within range. One Transfiguration spell of 2nd level or lower on the target ends. If you are aware of at least one spell affecting the target, you can specify that spell in your mind. If you are unaware of what spells are affecting the target, one randomly selected spell ends. 

For a spell of a higher level on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell ends. 

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a Transfiguration spell on the target if the spell's level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.
