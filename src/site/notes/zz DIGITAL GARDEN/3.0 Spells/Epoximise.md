The Sticking Spell - Transfiguration Cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Duration: 1 hour

This spell transfigures the surface of an object to become extremely sticky. One object of your choice that you can see within range and that fits within a 1-foot cube adheres to anything it touches for the duration. If a creature wants to overcome the sticking effect, it can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it can pull the target object free or remove one thing from the target object's surface.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the cube's size increases by 1 foot for each slot level above 0.
