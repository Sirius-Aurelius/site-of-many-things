The Concussive Curse - 3rd-level Curse 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 90 feet 
Duration: Instantaneous 

The spell shoots out from your wand and a wave of thunderous force sweeps out from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from that point. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed. 

In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from that point by the spell’s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 100 feet. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
