The Tongue-Tying Curse - 1st-level Curse 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 90 feet 
Duration: 1 round 

If you're hit with this spell, this produces the strange sensation of your tongue being rolled up into the back of your mouth. Choose one being you can see within range. If it tries to cast a spell verbally before the end of its next turn, it must first succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell is wasted.
