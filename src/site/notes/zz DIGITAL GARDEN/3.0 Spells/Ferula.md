The Bandaging Charm - 1st-level Healing 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet 
Duration: 10 minutes 

Bandages and splints are conjured on a being you can see within range, with no more than half of its hit point maximum, and it gains hit points equal to two times your spellcasting ability modifier. Additionally, any Wisdom (Medicine) checks to stabilize that target within the duration are made at advantage, and if the target is successfully stabilized, it regains 1 hit point.
