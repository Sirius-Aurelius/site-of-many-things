The Vanishing Spell - 3rd-level Transfiguration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 ft
Duration: Instantaneous

One non-magical object or magical construct of your choice that you can see within range and that fits within a 1-foot cube is vanished. Vanished objects have been described as being transfigured to go "into non-being, which is to say, everything." Vanishing is often seen as the magical inverse of conjuration.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the cube's size increases by 1 foot for each slot level above 3rd.
