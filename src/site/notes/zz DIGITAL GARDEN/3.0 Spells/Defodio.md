The Gouging Spell - Charm cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet (5 foot cube)
Duration: Instantaneous

You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

If you target an area of stone or earth, you can instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 5 feet away. This movement doesnâ€™t have enough force to cause damage.

If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour. If cast multiple times, only two of this effect can be active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as a bonus action.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the cube's size and distance the earth can be moved are each increased by 5 feet and the number of active normal/difficult terrain effects increase by 1 for each slot level above 0.
